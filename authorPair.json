The first 2 pregnancies resulted in spontaneous abortions. Based on the proband karyotype, his father and half-brother were subjected to cytogenetic analysis, and both showed 46,XY, t(3;6)(q12;q27). After genetic counseling, the proband chose to continue the pregnancy. During the third pregnancy, the subject gave birth to a normal male infant. For parental carriers with balanced chromosomal translocations, natural pregnancy should be considered during genetic counseling.

{"Abstract": ["In a worldwide collaborative effort, 19,630 Y-chromosomes were sampled from 129 different populations in 51 countries. These chromosomes were typed for 23 short-tandem repeat (STR) loci (DYS19, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS385ab, DYS437, DYS438, DYS439, DYS448, DYS456, DYS458, DYS635, GATAH4, DYS481, DYS533, DYS549, DYS570, DYS576, and DYS643) and using the PowerPlex Y23 System (PPY23, Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). Locus-specific allelic spectra of these markers were determined and a consistently high level of allelic diversity was observed. A considerable number of null, duplicate and off-ladder alleles were revealed. Standard single-locus and haplotype-based parameters were calculated and compared between subsets of Y-STR markers established for forensic casework. The PPY23 marker set provides substantially stronger discriminatory power than other available kits but at the same time reveals the same general patterns of population structure as other marker sets. A strong correlation was observed between the number of Y-STRs included in a marker set and some of the forensic parameters under study. Interestingly a weak but consistent trend toward smaller genetic distances resulting from larger numbers of markers became apparent.

{"Abstract": ["In the conventional analysis of complex diseases, the control and case samples are assumed to be of great purity. However, due to the heterogeneity of disease samples, many disease genes are even not always consistently up-/down-regulated, leading to be under-estimated. This problem will seriously influence effective personalized diagnosis or treatment. The expression variance and expression covariance can address such a problem in a network manner. But, these analyses always require multiple samples rather than one sample, which is generally not available in clinical practice for each individual. To extract the common and specific network characteristics for individual patients in this paper, a novel differential network model, e.g. personalized dysfunctional gene network, is proposed to integrate those genes with different features, such as genes with the differential gene expression (DEG), genes with the differential expression variance (DEVG) and gene-pairs with the differential expression covariance (DECG) simultaneously, to construct personalized dysfunctional networks. This model uses a new statistic-like measurement on differential information, i.e., a differential score (DEVC), to reconstruct the differential expression network between groups of normal and diseased samples; and further quantitatively evaluate different feature genes in the patient-specific network for each individual. This DEVC-based differential expression network (DEVC-net) has been applied to the study of complex diseases for prostate cancer and diabetes. (1) Characterizing the global expression change between normal and diseased samples, the differential gene networks of those diseases were found to have a new bi-coloured topological structure, where their non hub-centred sub-networks are mainly composed of genes/proteins controlling various biological processes. (2) The differential expression variance/covariance rather than differential expression is new informative sources, and can be used to identify genes or gene-pairs with discriminative power, which are ignored by traditional methods. (3) More importantly, DEVC-net is effective to measure the expression state or activity of different feature genes and their network or modules in one sample for an individual. All of these results support that DEVC-net indeed has a clear advantage to effectively extract discriminatively interpretable features of gene/protein network of one sample (i.e. personalized dysfunctional network) even when disease samples are heterogeneous, and thus can provide new features like gene-pairs, in addition to the conventional individual genes, to the analysis of the personalized diagnosis and prognosis, and a better understanding on the underlying biological mechanisms.

{"Abstract": ["We investigated the correlation between genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 enzyme genes and the outcome of clopidogrel treatment in 118 coronary disease patients after percutaneous coronary intervention at the Chinese PLA General Hospital. Patients were divided into an ischemia event relapse group (IERG) and a non-IERG group (NIERG) based on relapse of ischemia events within 6 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. Ischemia occurred in 26.27% of patients. Thromboelastogram platelet mapping results showed that compared with the NIERG, the ADP-induced platelet inhibition ratio in the IERG was significantly lower (31.33 \u00b1 24.91% vs 54.68 \u00b1 26.63%, P < 0.05). The platelet inhibition ratio of patients carrying mutant alleles CYP3A5*3 (41.98 \u00b1 29.33% vs 52.89 \u00b1 26.49%), CYP2C19*2 (43.15 \u00b1 27.97% vs 55.89 \u00b1 26.71%), and P2Y12*1 (38.74 \u00b1 24.36% vs 52.19 \u00b1 28.58%) was lower than patients with the wild-type alleles. The frequency of ischemia event relapse in patients with the mutant alleles CYP3A5*3 and CYP2C19*2 was significantly higher than patients carrying the G/G genotype; however, there was no significant difference between patients carrying the T/T genotype and C allele of P2Y12*1. Thus, coexisting polymorphisms of CYP3A5*3 and 2C19*2, but not P2Y12*1, play an important role in the variability of clopidogrel's curative effect.

The median correlation coefficient between patients and xenografts is 0.94, which is higher than that between patients and cell line panel or between patients with the same tumor. Major differential gene expressions in PDX occur in the engraftment of human tumor tissue into mice, while gene expressions are relatively stable over passages. 48 genes are frequently differentially expressed in PDX mice of multiple cancers. They are enriched in extracellular matrix and immune response, and some are reported as targets for anticancer drugs. A simulation study showed that expression change between PDX and patient tumor (6%) would result in acceptable change in drug sensitivity (3%). Our findings demonstrate that PDX mice represent the gene-expression and drug-response features of primary tumors effectively, and it is recommended to monitoring the overall expression profiles and drug target genes in clinical application.

{"Abstract": ["In the medical imaging field, molecular imaging is a rapidly developing discipline and forms many imaging modalities, providing us effective tools to visualize, characterize, and measure molecular and cellular mechanisms in complex biological processes of living organisms, which can deepen our understanding of biology and accelerate preclinical research including cancer study and medicine discovery. Among many molecular imaging modalities, although the penetration depth of optical imaging and the approved optical probes used for clinics are limited, it has evolved considerably and has seen spectacular advances in basic biomedical research and new drug development. With the completion of human genome sequencing and the emergence of personalized medicine, the specific drug should be matched to not only the right disease but also to the right person, and optical molecular imaging should serve as a strong adjunct to develop personalized medicine by finding the optimal drug based on an individual's proteome and genome. In this process, the computational methodology and imaging system as well as the biomedical application regarding optical molecular imaging will play a crucial role.

{"Abstract": ["Previous studies have raised interest in using the genotyping of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 to guide warfarin dosing. However, there is lack of solid evidence to prove that genotype plus clinical algorithm provides improved clinical outcomes than the single clinical algorithm. The results of recent reported clinical trials are paradoxical and needs to be systematically evaluated. In this study, we aim to assess whether genotype plus clinical algorithm of warfarin is superior to the single clinical algorithm through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). All relevant studies from PubMed and reference lists from Jan 1, 1995 to Jan 13, 2014 were extracted and screened. Eligible studies included randomized trials that compared clinical plus pharmacogenetic algorithms group to single clinical algorithm group using adult (\u2265 18 years) patients with disease conditions that require warfarin use. We further used fix-effect models to calculate the mean difference or the risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs to analyze the extracted data. The statistical heterogeneity was calculated using I(2). The percentage of time within the therapeutic INR range was considered to be the primary clinical outcome. The initial search strategy identified 50 citations and 7 trials were eligible. These seven trials included 1,910 participants, including 960 patients who received genotype plus clinical algorithm of warfarin dosing and 950 patients who received clinical algorithm only. We discovered that the percentage of time within the therapeutic INR range of the genotype-guided group was improved compared with the standard group in the RCTs when the initial standard dose was fixed (95% CI 0.09-0.40; I(2) = 47.8%). However, for the studies using non-fixed initial doses, the genotype-guided group failed to exhibit statistically significant outcome compared to the standard group. No significant difference was observed in the incidences of adverse events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84-1.04; I(2) = 0%, p = 0.647) and death rates (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.46-4.05; I(2) = 10.4%, p = 0.328) between the two groups. Allocation to genotype plus clinical algorithm may be associated with a significant improvement of the percentage of time within the therapeutic INR range for patients adopting fixed dose of warfarin. The incidence of total adverse events and death rates did not differ between these two groups. Further experiments need to be conducted to confirm these findings."], "Citation": ["J Thromb Thrombolysis. 2015 Feb;39(2):228-34. doi: 10.1007/s11239-014-1099-9."], "TitleName": ["Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reveals an improved clinical outcome of using genotype plus clinical algorithm for warfarin dosing."], "AuthorsName": ["Liao Z", "1", "Feng S", "Ling P", "Zhang G"], "pmid": ["24962733 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Suzhou, 215000, Jiangsu, China."], "email": ["sdzgq0512@163.com"], "FullTextLink": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11239-014-1099-9"]},

{"Abstract": ["An enormous amount of sequence data has been generated with the development of new DNA sequencing technologies, which presents great challenges for computational biology problems such as haplotype phasing. Although arduous efforts have been made to address this problem, the current methods still cannot efficiently deal with the incoming flood of large-scale data. In this paper, we propose a flow network model to tackle haplotype phasing problem, and explain some classical haplotype phasing rules based on this model. By incorporating the heuristic knowledge obtained from these classical rules, we design an algorithm FNphasing based on the flow network model. Theoretically, the time complexity of our algorithm is (O(n(2)m+m(2)), which is better than that of 2SNP, one of the most efficient algorithms currently. After testing the performance of FNphasing with several simulated data sets, the experimental results show that when applied on large-scale data sets, our algorithm is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art Beagle algorithm.

{"Abstract": ["Paternity index was analyzed using five microsatellite loci among Chinese egg-laying ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Based on the paternity relationship that was identified by paternity index analysis, the estimated breeding value (EBV) was calculated using BLUP (best linear unbiased predictor) method. Body weight at first egg (BWF) is the only considered trait in this study. In total, 12 sires, 31 dams and 77 daughters were involved in the EBV calculation. The results demonstrated that five microsatellite loci's polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.795 in locus AY493338 to 0.957 in locus AY493264 with average 0.899; the parent-offspring relationships were built by these microsatellites' genotype, 12 families of half sibling and 2 families of full sibling were involved, and the relationship error is smaller than 10(-7). The EBV results suggest that the average EBV was significantly higher in females (average EBV is 10.234 and 0.1045 for mother and daughter, respectively) than males (average EBV is just -26.44). The EBV results on BWF were in good agreement with the principle of GH (growth hormone) expression in poultry.

{"Abstract": ["Cancer is a highly aggressive and devastating disease, and impediments to a cure arise not just from cancer itself. Targeted therapies are difficult to achieve since the majority of cancers are more intricate than ever imagined. Mainstream methodologies including chemotherapy and radiotherapy as routine clinical regimens frequently fail, eventually leading to pathologies that are refractory and incurable. One major cause is the gradual to rapid repopulation of surviving cancer cells during intervals of multiple-dose administration. Novel stress-responsive molecular pathways are increasingly unmasked and show promise as emerging targets for advanced strategies that aim at both de novo and acquired resistance. We highlight recent data reporting that treatments particularly those genotoxic can induce highly conserved damage responses in non-cancerous constituents of the tumor microenvironment (TMEN). Master regulators, including but not limited to NF-kB and C/EBP-\u03b2, are implicated and their signal cascades culminate in a robust, chronic and genome-wide secretory program, forming an activated TMEN that releases a myriad of soluble factors. The damage-elicited but essentially off target and cell non-autonomous secretory phenotype of host stroma causes adverse consequences, among which is acquired resistance of cancer cells. Harnessing signals arising from the TMEN, a pathophysiological niche frequently damaged by medical interventions, has the potential to promote overall efficacy and improve clinical outcomes provided that appropriate actions are ingeniously integrated into contemporary therapies. Thereby, anticancer regimens should be well tuned to establish an innovative clinical avenue, and such advancement will allow future oncological treatments to be more specific, accurate, thorough and personalized.

{"Abstract": ["Researchers who have uncovered the presence of stem cells in an adult's central nervous system have not only challenged the dogma that new neurons cannot be generated during adulthood, but also shed light on the etiology and disease mechanisms underlying many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Brain trauma, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders pose enormous burdens at both personal and societal levels. Although medications for these disorders are widely used, the treatment mechanisms underlying the illnesses remain largely elusive. In the past decade, an increasing amount of evidence indicate that adult neurogenesis (i.e. generating new CNS neurons during adulthood) may be involved in the pathology of different CNS disorders, and thus neurogenesis may be a potential target area for treatments. Although new neurons were shown to be a major player in mediating treatment efficacy of neurological and psychotropic drugs on cognitive functions, it is still debatable if the altered production of new neurons can cause the disorders.

{"Abstract": ["Gastric neuroendocrine tumors (GNETs) are rare lesions characterized by hypergastrinemia that arise from enterochromaffin-like cells of the stomach. GNETs consist of a heterogeneous group of neoplasms comprising tumor types of varying pathogenesis, histomorphologic characteristics, and biological behavior. A classification system has been proposed that distinguishes four types of GNETs; the clinicopathological features of the tumor, its prognosis, and the patient's survival strictly depend on this classification. Thus, correct management of patients with GNETs can only be proposed when the tumor has been classified by an accurate pathological and clinical evaluation of the patient. Recently developed cancer therapies such as inhibition of angiogenesis or molecular targeting of growth factor receptors have been used to treat GNETs, but the only definitive therapy is the complete resection of the tumor. Here we review the literature on GNETs, and summarize the classification, clinicopathological features (especially prognosis), clinical presentations and current practice of management of GNETs. We also present the latest findings on new gene markers for GNETs, and discuss the effective drugs developed for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of GNETs.

{"Abstract": ["This study aimed at investigating the characteristics of invasive breast cancer among molecular subtypes. Patients with invasive breast cancer, with complete information on the expressions of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), were recruited. \u03c7 tests and an unconditional logistic regression model were used for statistical analysis. The percentages of luminal A, luminal B, HER2/neu, and triple-negative subtypes were 54.2% (1639/3021), 14.0% (422/3021), 8.9% (269/3021), and 22.9% (691/3021), respectively. Differences among molecular subtypes (P<0.05) in tumor size, stage, pathologic type, and lymph node status were observed. The HER2/neu, luminal B, and triple-negative subtypes were more aggressive compared with the luminal A subtype in tumor stage, lymph node status, or pathologic type (P<0.05), when the findings were adjusted for age. Molecular subtypes were distributed differently between both age groups and regional groups on the basis of the socioeconomic status (P<0.05). In conclusion, luminal A and triple-negative subtypes were the 2 main subtypes of invasive breast cancer in China. The variations of molecular subtypes in pathology, age, and regional distribution may give some suggestions for updating treatment guidelines and individualized treatment strategies in China.

In order to evaluate the forensic applicability of D10S2325 and to construct a preliminary database, the genotype distributions and allele frequencies in three major ethnic groups were investigated. The population samples included Caucasians (Germans), Africans (African Americans), and Asians (Chinese). A total of 520 samples from unrelated individuals was analyzed by Amp-FLP. An example of each allele and new alleles were sequenced. Allele determination was carried out by comparison with a sequenced human allelic ladder made in-house. This pentanucleotide STR provided easily interpretable results. A total of 15 alleles was found in our population samples. Three new alleles were observed and named as alleles 19 and 21 based on the number of repeat motifs, while allele 19 can be divided further into two alleles, 19a and 19 according to analysis of the sequence. No evidence of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed. In 64 confirmed father/mother/child triplets no mutation event was observed.

However, currently, there are still inconsistencies among results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Epidemiological and immunological studies have been inconsistent, and in some cases, the results even directly contradict each other. In certain populations, dietary interventions have shown promising signs. Due to the complexity of the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, the issue of whether dietary interventions can prevent the development and progression of allergic disease requires collaborative work among clinicians, epidemiologists, immunologists, and geneticists. Ideally, this will identify population subgroups that would benefit the most from dietary intervention. The individuals in those populations could then be screened.

{"Abstract": ["VEGFR and HER2 are both important transmembrane proteins associated with several types of cancer. Overexpression of these 2 proteins had long been thought to contribute to cancer progression and poor outcomes, thus, therapies targeting HER-2 and VEGFA signaling pathways have been applied in recent years. Herceptin is a HER-2 targeted antibody that being widely used for the management of HER-2 positive breast cancer, which demonstrate significant benefits in both the metastatic and adjuvant settings. However, acquired resistance develops in most treated patients despite treatment in as early as 10 months. Identification of subpopulations best suited for and most likely to respond to Herceptin is of utmost importance. We analyzed the signaling pathways of HER-2 and found that HER-2 shares a very similar downstream network with VEGFA, while LGR5 lies in the upstream of VEGFA and could promotes its expression through CTNNB1. This discovery suggests that the LGR5 directed VEGFA overexpression may activate downstream signals of HER-2 despite Herceptin treatment. Here, we hypothesized that in LGR5 overexpressing breast cancer cases, activation of VEGFA-VRGFR bypass may account for the resistance to HER-2 directed therapies. Concurrent inhibition of VEGFR might enhance Herceptin sensitivity and moreover reverse the resistant phenotype in HER-2 positive breast cancer. Thus, we proposed alternate regimens to increase the efficacy of Herceptin-based therapy.

{"Abstract": ["Clinical response to therapeutic treatments often varies among individual patients, ranging from beneficial effect to even fatal adverse reaction. Pharmacogenomics holds the promise of personalized medicine through elucidating genetic determinants responsible for pharmacological outcomes (e.g., cytotoxicities to anticancer drugs) and therefore guide the prescription decision prior to drug treatment. Besides traditional candidate gene-based approaches, technical advances have begun to allow application of whole-genome approaches to pharmacogenomic discovery. In particular, comprehensive understanding of human genetic variation provides the basis for applying GWAS (genome-wide association studies) in pharmacogenomic research to identify genomic loci associated with pharmacological phenotypes (e.g., individual dose requirement for warfarin). We therefore briefly reviewed the background for pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomic research with statins and warfarin as examples for the GWAS discovery and their clinical implementation. In conclusion, with some challenges, whole-genome approaches such as GWAS have allowed unprecedented progress in identifying genetic variants associated with pharmacological phenotypes, as well as provided foundation for the next wave of pharmacogenomic discovery utilizing sequencing-based approaches. Furthermore, investigation of the complex interactions among genetic and epigenetic factors on the whole-genome scale will become the post-GWAS research focus for pharmacologic complex traits."], "Citation": ["Wiley Interdiscip Rev Syst Biol Med. 2013 Jan-Feb;5(1):1-9. doi: 10.1002/wsbm.1199.

{"Abstract": ["The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily plays a key role in the oxidative metabolism of a wide range of drugs and exogenous chemicals. CYP2C8 is the principal enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel in the human liver. Nearly all previous works about polymorphic variants of CYP2C8 were focused on unpurified proteins, either cells or human liver microsomes; therefore their structure-function relationships were unclear. In this study, two polymorphic enzymes of CYP2C8 (CYP2C8.4 (I264M) and CYP2C8 P404A) were expressed in E. coli and purified. Metabolic activities of paclitaxel by the two purified polymorphic enzymes were observed. The activity of CYP2C8.4 was 25% and CYP2C8 P404A was 30% of that of WT CYP2C8, respectively. Their structure-function relationships were systematically investigated for the first time. Paclitaxel binding ability of CYP2C8.4 increased about two times while CYP2C8 P404A decreased about two times than that of WT CYP2C8. The two polymorphic mutant sites of I264 and P404, located far from active site and substrate binding sites, significantly affect heme and/or substrate binding. This study indicated that two important nonsubstrate recognition site (SRS) residues of CYP2C8 are closely related to heme binding and/or substrate binding.

{"Abstract": ["The concepts of Western medicine in treating tumor have changed markedly in recent years, and begun to put more emphasis on the whole survival status of patients. With recent emergence of targeted drugs, it was found that curative effects of the same targeted drugs in treating patients with the same tumor type even the same tumor pathological subtype but different therapeutic targets may be different. On the contrary, the curative effects of different targeted drugs in treating patients with different tumor types but the same therapeutic targets may be similar. Accordingly, the viewpoint of personalized therapy is advocated in Western medicine. Under the guidance of syndrome differentiation treatment in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), patients with the same tumor and different syndromes should be treated by different herbs, and patients with different tumor and the same syndrome should be treated by the same herbs.

Chinese and Western medical systems are dissimilar in terms of value orientations, thinking style, and research directions because of their different historical and cultural backgrounds. Individualized treatment in modern medicine is mainly established based on individual genome information and the differences in mononucleotide polymorphisms. However, such treatment method is expensive, creates an uncertain genetic marker, and leads to different result interpretations, among other problems. The Chinese constitutional theory developed in the 1970s expresses the principle behind Chinese health medicine and individual treatment and provides the corresponding methods. The Chinese constitutional theory divides the constitution of the Chinese population into nine categories based on established classification criteria. It promotes the study of the relationship of each constitution to diseases and Chinese medicine preparation toward adjusting the constitution and preventing diseases. The theory also provides methods and tools for individualized treatment. Constitution identification shows the direction and provides the core technology for the evaluation of the health status.

However, microarray technology in cancer diagnosis or prognosis has been primarily used for the statistical evaluation of patient populations, and thus excludes inter-individual variability and patient-specific predictions. Here we propose a metric called clinical confidence that serves as a measure of prognostic reliability to facilitate the shift from population-wide to personalized cancer prognosis using microarray-based predictive models. The performance of sample-based models predicted with different clinical confidences was evaluated and compared systematically using three large clinical datasets studying the following cancers: breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and neuroblastoma. Survival curves for patients, with different confidences, were also delineated. The results show that the clinical confidence metric separates patients with different prediction accuracies and survival times. Samples with high clinical confidence were likely to have accurate prognoses from predictive models. Moreover, patients with high clinical confidence would be expected to live for a notably longer or shorter time if their prognosis was good or grim based on the models, respectively.

{"Abstract": ["Nutrition research is increasingly concerned with the complex interactions between multicomponent dietary ingredients and the human metabolic regulatory system. The substantiation of nutritional health benefits is challenged by the intrinsic complexity of macro- and micronutrients and individualized human metabolic responses. Metabonomics, uniquely suited to assess metabolic responses to deficiencies or excesses of nutrients, is used to characterize the metabolic phenotype of individuals integrating genetic polymorphisms, metabolic interactions with commensal and symbiotic partners such as gut microbiota, as well as environmental and behavioral factors including dietary preferences. The two profiling strategies, metabolic phenotyping (metabotyping) and phytochemical profiling (phytoprofiling), greatly facilitate the measurement of these important health determinants and the discovery of new biomarkers associated with nutritional requirements and specific phytochemical interventions. This paper presents an overview of the applications of these two profiling approaches for personalized nutrition research, with a focus on recent advances in the study of the role of phytochemicals in regulating the human or animal metabolic regulatory system.

{"Abstract": ["Schizophrenia is a widespread mental disease with a prevalence of about 1% in the world population, and heritability of up to 80%. Drug therapy is an important approach to treating the disease. However, the curative effect of antipsychotic is far from satisfactory in terms of tolerability and side effects. Many studies have indicated that about 30% of the patients exhibit little or no improvements associated with antipsychotics. The response of individual patients who are given the same dose of the same drug varies considerably. In addition, antipsychotic drugs are often accompanied by adverse drug reactions (ADRs), which can cause considerable financial loss in addition to the obvious societal harm. So, it is strongly recommended that personalized medicine should be implemented both to improve drug efficacy and to minimize adverse events and toxicity. There is therefore a need for pharmacogenomic studies into the factors affecting response of schizophrenia patients to antipsychotic drugs to provide informed guidance for clinicians. Individual differences in drug response is due to a combination of many complex factors including ADEM (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) process, transporting, binding with receptor and intracellular signal transduction. Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic studies have successfully identified genetic variants that contribute to this interindividual variability in antipsychotics response. In addition, epigenetic factors such as methylation of DNA and regulation by miRNA have also been reported to play an important role in the complex interactions between the multiple genes and environmental factors which influence individual drug response phenotypes in patients. In this review, we will focus on the latest research on polymorphisms of candidate genes that code for drug metabolic enzymes (CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, etc.), drug transporters (mainly ABCB1) and neurotransmitter receptors (dopamine receptors and serotonin receptors, etc.).

Unfortunately, not all patients can achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR) with this regimen. SVR rates are approximately 80% in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2, 3, 5 and 6 and 40%-50% in patients with genotype 1 and 4. Therefore, strategies to improve SVR rates have been an important issue for clinical physicians. Several direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have significantly higher SVR rates when combined with pegIFN-\u03b1 and RBV than pegIFN-\u03b1 and RBV alone. Treatments containing DAAs have several advantages over the previous SOC, including higher specificity and efficacy, shorter treatment durations, fewer side effects, and oral administration. Based on these advantages, treatment with pegIFN-\u03b1 and RBV plus telaprevir or boceprevir has become the current SOC for patients with genotype 1 HCV infection. However, many patients are either not eligible for therapy or decline treatment due to coexisting relative or absolute contraindications as well as an inability to tolerate the hematological side effects and adverse events caused by the new SOC.

We reported a hydrothermal pressure method of simultaneous deparaffinization and lysis of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue followed by conventional chaotropic salt column purification to obtain high quality DNA for mutation analysis using PCR-base direct sequencing. This study assessed the feasibility of using this method to screen for exons 18-21 of EGFR and exon 2 of KRAS gene mutations in surgical resection and core needle biopsy specimens from 251 NSCLC patients. EGFR mutations were identified in 140 (55.8%) NSCLC patients (118 in adenocarcinoma, 11 in squamous cell carcinoma, 7 in adenocarcinoma and 4 in NSCLC-not otherwise specified), including four novel substitutions (L718M, A743V, L815P, V819E). EGFR mutations were frequently present in female patients (72 of 113, 63.7%) and NSCLC with adenocarcinoma component (125/204, 61.3%) with statistical significance. Twenty-one patients had multiple mutations at different exons of EGFR, in which seventeen patients had deletions in exon 19.

Herein we used direct sequencing to analyze mutation status for 676 patients in KRAS (codons 12, 13 and 61), BRAF (exon 11 and exon 15), PIK3CA (exon 9 and exon 20) and NRAS (codons12, 13 and 61). Clinicopathological characteristics associations were analyzed together with overall survival (OS) of metastatic colorectal cancer patients (mCRC). We found 35.9% (242/674) tumors harbored a KRAS mutation, 6.96% (47/675) harbored a BRAF mutation, 9.9% (62/625) harbored a PIK3CA mutation and 4.19% (26/621) harbored a NRAS mutation.

The genome sequencing of CTCs could offer noninvasive prognosis or even diagnosis, but has been hampered by low single-cell genome coverage of scarce CTCs. Here, we report the use of the recently developed multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles for whole-genome amplification of single CTCs from lung cancer patients. We observed characteristic cancer-associated single-nucleotide variations and insertions/deletions in exomes of CTCs. These mutations provided information needed for individualized therapy, such as drug resistance and phenotypic transition, but were heterogeneous from cell to cell. In contrast, every CTC from an individual patient, regardless of the cancer subtypes, exhibited reproducible copy number variation (CNV) patterns, similar to those of the metastatic tumor of the same patient. Interestingly, different patients with the same lung cancer adenocarcinoma (ADC) shared similar CNV patterns in their CTCs. Even more interestingly, patients of small-cell lung cancer have CNV patterns distinctly different from those of ADC patients. Our finding suggests that CNVs at certain genomic loci are selected for the metastasis of cancer. The reproducibility of cancer-specific CNVs offers potential for CTC-based cancer diagnostics.

Human cancer tissues that are maintained in intravital biobanks (or living tissue banks) retain native tumor microenvironment, tissue architecture, hormone responsiveness and cell-to-cell signalling properties. Intravital biobanks replicate the structural complexity and heterogeneity of human cancers, making them an ideal platform for preclinical studies. The application of omics with intravital biobanks renders them more active, which makes it possible for the cancer-related evaluations to be dynamically monitored on a real-time basis. Integrating intravital biobank and modern omics will provide a useful tool for the discovery and development of new drugs or novel therapeutic strategies.

In this respect surgical pathology (the traditional tissue diagnosis) is but a tool. It is not, of itself, the purpose of pathology practice; and change is in the air. This January 2014 issue of Applied Immunohistochemistry and Molecular Morphology (AIMM) embraces that change by the incorporation of the agenda and content of the journal Diagnostic Molecular Morphology (DMP). Over a decade ago AIMM introduced and promoted the concept of \"molecular morphology,\" and has sought to publish molecular studies that correlate with the morphologic features that continue to define cancer and many diseases. That intent is now reinforced and extended by the merger with DMP, as a logical and timely response to the growing impact of a wide range of genetic and molecular technologies that are beginning to reshape the way in which pathology is practiced. The use of molecular and genomic techniques already demonstrates clear value in the diagnosis of disease, with treatment tailored specifically to individual patients. Personalized medicine is the future, and personalized medicine demands personalized pathology. The need for integration of the flood of new molecular data, with surgical pathology, digital pathology, and the full range of pathology data in the electronic medical record has never been greater. This review describes the possible impact of these pressures upon the discipline of pathology, and examines possible outcomes. There is a sense of excitement and adventure.

{"Abstract": ["Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of sustained cardiac arrhythmia in humans and is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Emerging evidence indicates that abnormal cardiovascular development is involved in the pathogenesis of AF. In this study, the coding exons and splice sites of the NKX2-5 gene, which encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor essential for cardiovascular genesis, were sequenced in 146 unrelated patients with lone AF as well as the available relatives of the mutation carriers. A total of 700 unrelated ethnically matched healthy individuals used as controls were genotyped. The disease-causing potential of the identified NKX2-5 variations was predicted by MutationTaster and PolyPhen-2. The functional characteristics of the mutant NKX2-5 proteins were analyzed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. As a result, two heterozygous NKX2-5 mutations, including a previously reported p.E21Q and a novel p.T180A mutation, were identified in two families with AF transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern. The mutations co-segregated with AF in the families with complete penetrance. The detected substitutions, which altered the amino acids highly conserved evolutionarily across species, were absent in 700 control individuals and were both predicted to be causative. Functional analyses demonstrated that the NKX2-5 mutants were associated with significantly decreased transcriptional activity compared with their wild-type counterpart. The findings expand the spectrum of NKX2-5 mutations linked to AF and provide additional evidence that dysfunctional NKX2-5 may confer vulnerability to AF, suggesting the potential benefit for the early prophylaxis and personalized treatment of AF.

However, the efficacy of induction chemotherapy is closely related to locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, and overall survival after the treatment. A pseudotargeted metabolomics revealed that metabolites involved in glycolysis and amino acid metabolism were inversely regulated in patients with different chemotherapy responses, and most fatty acids, steroids, and antioxidant substances were up-regulated in all patients after the treatment. Among the metabolites, lactic acid, glucose, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, leucine, and glycerol were remarkably associated with induction chemotherapy efficacy. Subsequently, lactic acid, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid were defined as potential biomarkers of the suitability and efficacy of induction chemotherapy. Our results show that 100.0 and 84.37% of patients with different chemotherapy efficacy were correctly identified in the training and test sets, respectively. Moreover, patient suitability for treatment was correctly predicted for 100.0, 81.25, and 100.0% of patients in the training, test, and external validation sets, respectively. In conclusion, metabolites related to glycolysis, redox homeostasis, and anabolic progress were indicative of induction chemotherapy efficacy both pre- and post-chemotherapy and beneficial for outcome evaluation and prediction.

{"Abstract": ["Natural products with biodiversity and chemical variations present a rich source for the discovery and development of new therapeutic and preventive drugs. Bioactive components derived from natural medicines including traditional Chinese medicine have been widely used for the screening of effective and safe anticancer drugs.

Considering the high complexity of pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of natural product anticancer agents, there are several major challenges in understanding mechanisms of action in vitro and in vivo for these agents. The recent rapid progress made in molecular and cell biology, genetics and genomics, and translational medicine, preclinical investigations provides an impetus for a better understanding of mechanisms of action and structure-activity relationships (SAR) of natural products. In addition, the simultaneous evaluation of PD-PK characterizations would allow a full assessment of the safety, efficacy, and indication of natural product anticancer drugs in various regimens and in various clinical settings. In this review, we provide a brief summary for recent advances in translational pharmacology, focusing on target validation and PK-PD, MOA, and SAR.

{"Abstract": ["The assessment of cardiovascular function is becoming increasingly important for the care of patients with single-ventricle defects. However, most measurement methods available in the clinical setting cannot provide a separate measure of cardiac function and loading conditions. In the present study, a numerical method has been proposed to compensate for the limitations of clinical measurements. The main idea was to estimate the parameters of a cardiovascular model by fitting model simulations to patient-specific clinical data via parameter optimization. Several strategies have been taken to establish a well-posed parameter optimization problem, including clinical data-matched model development, parameter selection based on an extensive sensitivity analysis, and proper choice of parameter optimization algorithm. The numerical experiments confirmed the ability of the proposed parameter optimization method to uniquely determine the model parameters given an arbitrary set of clinical data. The method was further tested in four patients undergoing the Fontan operation. Obtained results revealed a prevalence of ventricular abnormalities in the patient cohort and at the same time demonstrated the presence of marked inter-patient differences and preoperative to postoperative changes in cardiovascular function.

{"Abstract": ["The health burden of cancer is increasing in China, with more than 1\u00b76 million people being diagnosed and 1\u00b72 million people dying of the disease each year. As in most other countries, breast cancer is now the most common cancer in Chinese women; cases in China account for 12\u00b72% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers and 9\u00b76% of all deaths from breast cancer worldwide. China's proportional contribution to global rates is increasing rapidly because of the population's rising socioeconomic status and unique reproductive patterns. In this Review we present an overview of present control measures for breast cancer across China, and emphasise epidemiological and socioeconomic diversities and disparities in access to care for various subpopulations. We describe demographic differences between China and high-income countries, and also within geographical and socioeconomic regions of China. These disparities between China and high-income countries include younger age at onset of breast cancer; the unique one-child policy; lower rates of provision and uptake for screening for breast cancer; delays in diagnosis that result in more advanced stage of disease at presentation; inadequate resources; and a lack of awareness about breast cancer in the Chinese population. Finally, we recommend key measures that could contribute to improved health outcomes for patients with breast cancer in China.

In recent years, a newly proposed optimization therapy has provided us with a new approach to solve this problem. The key points in this optimization therapy are to initiate antiviral therapy with an appropriate agent at the correct time point, and to adjust treatments in patients with poor early responses by adding a second agent or switching to another more potent agent.

{"Abstract": ["Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly complex disease that is generally resistant to commonly used chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Consequently, there is an urgent need for the development of new treatment strategies for this devastating disease. In the past decade, tremendous progress has been achieved in the molecular stratification of HCCs for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-making. To date, the molecular classification of HCCs has been carried out through transcriptomic, genetic and epigenetic profiling of tumors. Such research has led to identification of several potential molecular targets in HCC, and subsequently, development of novel systemic agents for the treatment of HCC has begun in earnest. In this article, we review the current knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC and outline potential areas for application of this knowledge in a clinical setting. As a typical virus and inflammation-associated cancer, both host immune response and tumor microenvironment have crucial roles in HCC pathogenesis. In addition, we examine the potential of immunotherapy and strategies targeting various components of the tumor microenvironment, as well as novel molecular and cellular targets in HCC such as cancer stem cells."], "Citation": ["Front Med. 2012 Jun;6(2):122-33. doi: 10.1007/s11684-012-0193-7.

In this systematic review, we aimed to review the evidence implicating miRNAs in the pathogenesis of chondrogenesis and OA. Systematic reviews of PubMed and Embase were performed to search for studies using strings of miRNAs, non-coding RNAs, cartilage, chondrocytes, chondrogenesis, chondrocytogenesis and OA. The identified studies were retrieved, and the references provided were searched. The selected studies were required to focus on the role of miRNAs in chondrogenesis and OA. The results of this review indicated that more than 25 miRNAs have been implicated in chondrogenesis and OA. In particular, chondrocytogenesis, chondrogenic differentiation, chondrocyte proliferation, chondrocyte hypertrophy, endochondral ossification, and proteolytic enzyme regulation are targeted or facilitated by more than 1 miRNA. To date, limited efforts have been performed to evaluate translational applications for this knowledge. Novel therapeutic strategies have been developed and are under investigation to selectively modulate miRNAs, which could potentially enable personalized OA therapy. miRNAs appear to be important modulators of chondrogenesis and OA.

{"Abstract": ["Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to be effective in the management of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) due to their immunomodulatory effects. In addition to prevention and treatment of GVHD, many studies have demonstrated that MSCs can promote hematopoietic engraftment, accelerate lymphocyte recovery, reduce the risk of graft failure, and repair tissue damage in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Bone marrow (BM) has been considered as the traditional source of MSCs, and most of the knowledge concerning MSCs comes from BM studies. However, BM-derived MSCs have several limitations for their clinical application. Fetal-type MSCs can be isolated easier and proliferate faster in vitro as well as possessing a lower immunogenicity. Therefore, fetal-type MSCs, such as umbilical cord-derived MSCs, represent an excellent alternative source of MSCs. MSCs play multiple important roles in HSCT. Nevertheless, several issues regarding their clinical application remain to be discussed, including the safety of use in humans, the available sources and the convenience of obtaining MSCs, the quality control of in vitro-cultured MSCs and the appropriate cell passages, the optimum cell dose, and the optimum number of infusions. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate whether the rates of cancer relapse and infections increase when using MSCs for GVHD. There are still many questions regarding the clinical application of MSCs to HSCT that need to be answered, and further studies are warranted.

Generally, the application of stem cells for periodontal therapy in clinics will not be realized until the best cell(s) to use, the optimal dose, and an effective  mode of administration are identified. In particular, we need to better understand the mechanisms of action of stem cells after transplantation in the periodontium and to learn how to preciously control stem cell fates in the pathological environment around a tooth.

Cellular senescence was evaluated by senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) staining and an immunohistochemical analysis of p21 and p16 protein expression. The expression of type III collagen (Col III) and fibronectin (FN) in renal interstitium and the levels of serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, serum creatinine concentration (SCr), and 24-h urinary protein excretion were evaluated also.

Here I propose that cortical indexes, that indicate neuronal plastic changes in pain-related cortical areas, can be used as endpoint measurements for chronic pain. Such cortical indexes are not only useful for those chronic pain conditions where a suitable animal model is lacking, but also serve as additional screening methods for potential drugs to treat chronic pain in humans. These cortical indexes are activity-dependent immediate early genes, electrophysiological identified plastic changes and biochemical assays of signaling proteins.

{"Abstract": ["Lectin-like oxidized LDL (oxLDL) receptor-1 (LOX-1), a novel scavenger receptor highly expressed in human and experimental atherosclerotic lesions, is responsible for the uptake of oxLDL in vascular cells. We demonstrated previously that Tanshinone II-A (Tan), a pharmacologically active compound extracted from the rhizome of the Chinese herb Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, inhibits atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic rats, rabbits, and apolipoprotein-E deficient (ApoE\u207b/\u207b) mice. However, the precise mechanism by which Tan protects against atherogenesis remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we hypothesized that Tan can suppress the uptake of oxLDL by diminishing the expression of LOX-1 via suppression of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, thereby contributing to reduced macrophage foam cell formation. In cultured murine macrophages, oxLDL induced LOX-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels, was abrogated by addition of Tan or pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic acid ammonium salt (PDTC), a widely used inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, suggesting the involvement of NF-\u03baB. Tan also reduced LOX-1 expression in atherosclerotic lesions of ApoE\u207b/\u207b mice fed a high cholesterol diet. Mechanistically, Tan suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB P65 subunit and phosphorylation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 induced by oxLDL. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that Tan inhibited the nuclear protein binding to NF-\u03baB consensus sequence. Functionally, we observed that Tan inhibited DiI-oxLDL uptake by macrophages in a fashion similar to that produced by LOX-1 neutralizing antibody.

The history of RNAi has only about two decades, however, further studies have revealed that it is a potent method of gene silencing that has developed rapidly over the past few years as a result of its extensive importance in the study of genetics, molecular biology and physiology. RNAi technology has also recently yielded significant insight into dendritic cells (DCs) by helping to elucidate numerous mechanisms that regulate the development, activation and function of cells that mediate immunity. In addition, because of its ability to suppress gene expression effectively, this technique may be used to regulate the immune response for clinical purposes. As the key antigen presenting cells, DCs play a crucial part in the start of an immune response and in the enhancement and regulation of cell mediated immune reactions. The current studies indicated that targeting DCs with RNAi is a novel and effective therapeutic method for the fundamental research, and displayed great potential in clinical treatment."], "Citation": ["Mol Biol Rep. 2010 Jul;37(6):2635-44. doi: 10.1007/s11033-009-9789-7.

We argue that IB can benefit significantly from the integration solutions enabled by Semantic Web (SW) technologies. The SW enables scientists to share content beyond the boundaries of applications and websites, resulting into a web of data that is meaningful and understandable to any computers. In this review, we provide insight into how SW technologies can be used to build open, standardized and interoperable solutions for interdisciplinary integration on a global basis.

{"Abstract": ["Stem cell-based therapy has been one of the best documented approaches in regenerative medicine, promising cures for a multitude of diseases and disorders. However, the ex vivo expansion of stem cells and their in vivo delivery are restricted by the limited availability of stem cell sources, the excessive cost of commercialization, and the anticipated difficulties of clinical translation and regulatory approval. An alternative to adoptively transferred stem cells are cell populations already present in a patient's body, including stem/progenitor cells, which can be actively attracted to sites of injury. This technique, known as endogenous cell homing, has the potential to provide new therapeutic options for in situ tissue regeneration. Such options would be less costly and complex than approaches that require substantial ex vivo cell manipulation and that use artificial vehicles for cell delivery. Tissue regeneration methods that rely on endogenous stem/progenitor cell homing, local tissue responses, and functional stimulation thus offer new insights into in vivo tissue engineering and hold great promise for the future of translational medicine. Although such methods that take advantage of the latent endogenous regenerative potential of the patient are promising for the repair of damaged tissue, they are in need of further experimental support before application in late-stage diseases or severe tissue injury. This review is not meant to be exhaustive but gives a brief outlook on the promises, strategies, and current applications of endogenous stem cell homing for in situ tissue regeneration, with particular emphasis placed upon pharmacological means based on cell-instructive scaffolds and release technology to direct cell mobilization and recruitment.

{"Abstract": ["Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), TGF-\u03b2 receptor (TGF-\u03b2R), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are important in the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis, a result of renal fibroblast activation. The EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib attenuates glomerular fibrosis in hypertensive rats whereas dominant-negative EGFR attenuates interstitial fibrosis in mouse with acute renal ischemia. Thus, we studied the effects and molecular mechanisms of gefitinib in TGF-\u03b21-induced mitogenesis and collagen production in normal rat kidney interstitial fibroblast (NRK-49F) cells. We found that TGF-\u03b21 increased cell mitogenesis. TGF-\u03b21 also time-dependently increased cyclin D1 protein expression. TGF-\u03b21 rapidly transactivated EGFR. SB431542 (a type I TGF-\u03b2R kinase inhibitor) and SB203580 (a p38 kinase inhibitor) attenuated TGF-\u03b21-induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 protein. SB431542 and gefitinib attenuated TGF-\u03b21-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 kinase. SB431542 and gefitinib also attenuated TGF-\u03b21-induced cyclin D1 protein expression. Moreover, SB431542, gefitinib, PD98059 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor), and SB203580 attenuated TGF-\u03b21-induced cell mitogenesis. Finally, SB431542 and gefitinib attenuated TGF-\u03b21-induced collagen production.

{"Abstract": ["The exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) is associated with emphysema. In addition to chronic lung inflammation, emphysema is known mainly for the complex pathogenesis associated with imbalance of proteolytic and antiproteolytic activities, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of lung structural cells. Increasing evidence shows that erythromycin, which is a macrolide antibiotic, ameliorates chronic inflammation via mechanisms independent of its antibacterial activity. We hypothesize that erythromycin protects against CS-induced emphysema and inflammation in rats via its anti-inflammation and antiapoptosis action. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intratracheally solution twice and exposed to the CS, the control rats were administered saline intratracheally and exposed to ambient air for 3 weeks. Then, all the CS rats were distributed randomly into 3 groups and, respectively, treated orally with saline (LPS + CS + saline), Guilongkechuanning capsule (450 mg/kg) (LPS + CS + GLKCN), or erythromycin (100 mg/kg) (LPS + CS + ERY) 0.5 h before CS exposure for 2 weeks. On day 36, the rats were killed. The cytokines in serum were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The middle lobe of the right lung was removed for histology and apoptosis analyses, respectively. Emphysematous lesions and inflammatory cell infiltrations in the CS group were evident by a histologic analysis. Erythromycin protected significantly against the alveolar enlargement levels (P = 0.0017), reduced the pathologic apoptosis (P\u00a0= 0.0023) related with Bcl-2 (P = 0.0002) and Bax (P = 0.0002), and inhibited the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 (P = 0.0019) and TIMP-1 protein (P = 0.04) and the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio (P = 0.0002) in the lungs of CS-induced emphysema in rats. The protective effect of erythromycin on CS-induced emphysema and inflammation in rats is associated with a reduction in inflammation, imbalance of MMP-9/TIMP-1, and apoptosis of lung structural cells. However, erythromycin did not recover completely the emphysematous morphologic changes to the levels when compared with control rats.

{"Abstract": ["Recently, we demonstrated the expression of NKCC2, an absorptive isoform of NKCC specifically expressed in the kidney, in the rat gastrointestinal tract including the distal colonic mucosa. This study aims to investigate its localization in colonic epithelia and possible role in the colonic ion transport. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the expression and localization of NKCC2. The role of NKCC2 on the colonic ion transport was examined by mean of short-circuit current (I(SC)) monitoring. The results indicated that NKCC2 was expressed in the apical region of the epithelia in rat distal colon and human sigmoid colon. NKCC1, which is a secretive NKCC isoform, was localized predominantly in the basolateral membrane, which has been well documented. Serosal (basolateral) administration of bumetanide, an inhibitor of both NKCC1 and NKCC2, inhibited serosal forskolin-induced I(SC) increase by 66% but enhanced the luminal (apical) forskolin-induced I(SC) response by 63%. Furthermore, the blocking of epithelial Na(+) channels by apical addition of amiloride (10 \u03bcmol/L), K(+) channels by tetraethylammoniumion (TEA) (5 mmol/L), or glibenclimide (0.1 mmol/L) did not affect apical forskolin-induced I(SC) increase, excluding the involvement of cations, Na(+) and K(+), in the I(SC) response. The luminal forskolin-induced I(SC) increase was enhanced markedly by the apical pretreatment with bumetanide or the reduction of apical Cl(-) concentration by 114% and 198%, respectively, which were inhibited by apical addition of glibenclimide (1 mmol/L) by more than 60%. This finding suggests the involvement of an anion. Furthermore, the removal of basolateral HCO(3)(-) reduced apical forskolin-induced I(SC) by more than 75% indicated that the apical forskolin-induced I(SC) increase in rat distal colon was mediated by Cl(-) absorption and HCO(3)(-) secretion.

In preclinical and clinical studies, MSCs have been shown to be highly efficient in treating graft-versus-host disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, myocardial infarction, liver cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other disorders. The underlying therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs include their homing efficiency to the tissue injury sites, their differentiation potential, their capability to produce a large amount of trophic factors, and their immunomodulatory effect. Because tissue damage sites are complicated milieus with distinct types of inflammatory cells and factors, available data have demonstrated that the properties of MSCs could be fundamentally influenced by the inflammatory elements. Thus, an understanding of the interaction between MSCs and the inflammatory microenvironment will provide critical information in revealing the precise in vivo mechanisms of MSC-mediated therapeutic effects and designing more practical protocols for clinical use of these cells."], "Citation": ["Stem Cells Transl Med. 2012 Jan;1(1):51-8. doi: 10.5966/sctm.2011-0019.

{"Abstract": ["Gastric cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide. Although the rate of gastric cancer has declined dramatically over the past decades in most developed Western countries, it has not declined in East Asia. Currently, a radical gastrectomy is still the only curative treatment for gastric cancer. Over the last twenty years, however, surgery alone has been replaced by a multimodal perioperative approach. To achieve the maximum benefit from the perioperative treatment, a thorough evaluation of the tumor must first be performed. A complete assessment of gastric cancer is divided into two parts: staging and histology. According to the stage and histology of the cancer, perioperative chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy can be implemented, and perioperative targeted therapies such as trastuzumab may also play a role in this field. However, perioperative treatment approaches have not been widely accepted until a series of clinical trials were performed to evaluate the value of perioperative treatment.

Recent findings showed that pluripotency is defined by a state of balanced lineage potency, which can be artificially instated through various procedures, including the conventional Yamanaka strategy. As a type of pluripotent stem cell, iPSCs are subject to the usual concerns over purity of differentiated derivatives and risks of tumor formation when used for cell-based therapy, though they provide certain advantages in translational research, especially in the areas of personalized medicine, disease modeling and drug screening. iPSC-based technology, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and direct lineage conversion each will play distinct roles in specific aspects of translational medicine, and continue yielding surprises for scientists and the public.

As such, identifying lung cancer patients who are at high risk of developing severe radiation-induced damage (mainly radiation pneumonitis and radiation-induced esophageal toxicity) and applying effect intervention or monitoring techniques are important. Although human diversity to a certain amount is explained by clinical and dosimetric factors, the presence of specific genetic determinants also influences the occurrence of radiation-induced damage. Here we summarize the data on mechanisms of radiation pneumonitis and radiation-induced esophageal toxicity supporting the involvement of variances of genes in the evolution of radiation-induced damage. Furthermore, the available evidence from current clinical studies of genetic polymorphisms for the prediction of radiation pneumonitis and radiation-induced esophageal toxicity is discussed. Eventually, this may help to truly individualize radiotherapy, using a personal genetic profile of the most relevant genes for each lung cancer patient.

This paper discusses framework of TCM personalized medicine in classic literatures and in real-world clinical settings, and investigates the underlying mechanisms of TCM personalized medicine from the perspectives of network medicine. Based on 246 well-designed outpatient records on insomnia, by evaluating the personal biases of manifestation observation and preferences of herb prescriptions, we noted significant similarities between each herb prescriptions and symptom similarities between each encounters. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of TCM personalized medicine, we constructed a clinical phenotype network (CPN), in which the clinical phenotype entities like symptoms and diagnoses are presented as nodes and the correlation between these entities as links. This CPN is used to investigate the promiscuous boundary of syndromes and the co-occurrence of symptoms. The small-world topological characteristics are noted in the CPN with high clustering structures, which provide insight on the rationality of TCM personalized diagnosis and treatment.

{"Abstract": ["Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) along with carbon monoxide and nitric oxide is an important signaling molecule that has undergone large numbers of fundamental investigations. H2S is involved in various physiological activities associated with the regulation of homeostasis, vascular contractility, pro- and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as pro- and anti-apoptotic activities etc. However, the actions of H2S are influenced by its concentration, reaction time, and cell/disease types. Therefore, H2S is a signaling molecule without definite effect. The use of existing H2S donors is limited because of the instant release and short lifetime of H2S. Thus, translational medicine involving the sustained and controlled release of H2S is of great value for both scientific and clinical uses. H2S donation can be manipulated by different ways, including where H2S is given, how H2S is donated, or the specific structures of H2S-releasing drugs and H2S donor molecules. This review briefly summarizes recent progress in research on the physiological and pathological functions of H2S and H2S-releasing drugs, and suggests hope for future investigations.

{"Abstract": ["Adult mammals possess limited ability to regenerate their lost tissues or organs. The epoch-making strategy of inducing pluripotency in somatic cells incorporates multiple applications in regenerative medicine. However, concerns about the clinical translation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells still exist because of the occurrence of aberrancies, even in genome integration-free methods. As cellular reprogramming is multi-gene-oriented, versatile, bioactive small molecules could concomitantly modulate the transcriptional machinery and aid the generation of clinical grade iPS cells. The availability of optimal cell sources has additional influence on the clinical translation of iPS cells. Herein we provide a critical overview of methods and cell sources available for iPS cell production. We think the review will be a useful resource for researchers who aim to develop small molecules for speeding up the journey of iPS cells from the laboratory to the clinic.

{"Abstract": ["Genome instability is a hallmark of cancer cells. Chromosome instability (CIN), which is often mutually exclusive from hypermutation genotypes, represents a distinct subtype of genome instability. Hypermutations in cancer cells are due to defects in DNA repair genes, but the cause of CIN is still elusive. However, because of the extensive chromosomal abnormalities associated with CIN, its cause is likely a defect in a network of genes that regulate mitotic checkpoints and chromosomal organization and segregation. Emerging evidence has shown that the chromosomal decatenation checkpoint, which is critical for chromatin untangling and packing during genetic material duplication, is defective in cancer cells with CIN. The decatenation checkpoint is known to be regulated by a family of enzymes called topoisomerases. Among them, the gene encoding topoisomerase II\u03b1 (TOP2A) is commonly altered at both gene copy number and gene expression level in cancer cells. Thus, abnormal alterations of TOP2A, its interacting proteins, and its modifications may have a critical role in CIN in human cancers. Clinically, a large arsenal of topoisomerase inhibitors has been used to suppress DNA replication in cancer. However, they often lead to the secondary development of leukemia because of their effect on the chromosomal decatenation checkpoint. Therefore, topoisomerase drugs must be used judiciously and administered on an individual basis. In this review, we highlight the biological function of TOP2A in chromosome segregation and the mechanisms that regulate this enzyme's expression and activity. We also review the roles of TOP2A and related proteins in human cancers, and raise a perspective for how to target TOP2A in personalized cancer therapy."], "Citation": ["Oncogene. 2015 Jul 30;34(31):4019-31. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.332.

{"Abstract": ["Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 10-15% of all strokes and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Currently, no effective medical treatment is available to improve functional outcomes in patients with ICH. Potential therapies targeting secondary brain injury are arousing a great deal of interest in translational studies. Increasing evidence has shown that inflammation is the key contributor of ICH-induced secondary brain injury. Inflammation progresses in response to various stimuli produced after ICH. Hematoma components initiate inflammatory signaling via activation of microglia, subsequently releasing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to attract peripheral inflammatory infiltration. Hemoglobin (Hb), heme, and iron released after red blood cell lysis aggravate ICH-induced inflammatory injury. Danger associated molecular patterns such as high mobility group box 1 protein, released from damaged or dead cells, trigger inflammation in the late stage of ICH. Preclinical studies have identified inflammatory signaling pathways that are involved in microglial activation, leukocyte infiltration, toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, and danger associated molecular pattern regulation in ICH. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of ICH-induced inflammatory injury have facilitated the identification of several novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of ICH. This review summarizes recent progress concerning the mechanisms underlying ICH-induced inflammation. We focus on the inflammatory signaling pathways involved in microglial activation and TLR signaling, and explore potential therapeutic interventions by targeting the removal of hematoma components and inhibition of TLR signaling.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common pathological type of lung cancer, divided into squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.

With increased understanding of molecular alternations in NSCLC, considerable efforts have focused on the development of personalized molecular-targeted therapies. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulates tumor development, growth, and proliferation of NSCLC. Various novel inhibitors targeting this pathway have been identified in preclinical studies or clinical trials. Some genetic alternations may be considered sensitive or resistant biomarkers to these inhibitors. Sometimes, upregulation of RTK and the downstream PI3K pathway or upregulation of the ERK pathway by compensatory feedback reactivation in response to these inhibitors also lead to drug resistance. Therefore, combination therapy of these inhibitors and other targeted inhibitors such as EGFR-TKI or MEK inhibitors according to genetic status and categories of inhibitors is required to enhance the efficacy of these inhibitors.

{"Abstract": ["Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynecological cancer around the world, with high morbidity in industrialized countries. Early diagnosis is key in reducing its morbidity rate. Yet, robust biomarkers, diagnostics, and animal models are still limited for ovarian cancer. This calls for broader omics and systems science oriented diagnostics strategies. In this vein, the domestic chicken has been used as an ovarian cancer animal model, owing to its high rate of developing spontaneous epithelial ovarian tumors. Chicken blood has thus been considered a surrogate reservoir from which cancer biomarkers can be identified. However, the presence of highly abundant proteins in chicken blood has compromised the applicability of proteomics tools to study chicken blood owing to a lack of immunodepletion methods. Here, we demonstrate that a combinatorial peptide ligand library (CPLL) can efficiently remove highly abundant proteins from chicken blood samples, consequently doubling the number of identified proteins. Using an integrated CPLL-1DGE-LC-MSMS workflow, we identified a catalog of 264 unique proteins. Functional analyses further suggested that most proteins were coagulation and complement factors, blood transport and binding proteins, immune- and defense-related proteins, proteases, protease inhibitors, cellular enzymes, or cell structure and adhesion proteins. Semiquantitative spectral counting analysis identified 10 potential biomarkers from the present chicken ovarian cancer model. Additionally, many human homologs of chicken blood proteins we have identified have been independently suggested as diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer, further triangulating our novel observations reported here. In conclusion, the CPLL-assisted proteomic workflow using the chicken ovarian cancer model provides a feasible platform for translational research to identify ovarian cancer biomarkers and understand ovarian cancer biology.

According to the optimal planning, patient-specific navigational templates produced by 3D printer were used to accurately guide the real surgical implantation. The fixation outcomes in term of the deviations of screw placement between preoperative and postoperative screw trajectories were measured and compared, including the screw lengths, entry point locations and screw directions. With virtual preoperative planning, we have achieved optimal and accurate fixation outcomes in the real clinical surgeries. The deviations of screw length was 1.57 \u00b1 5.77 mm, P > 0.05. The displacements of the entry points in the x-, y-, and z-axis were 0.23 \u00b1 0.62, 0.83 \u00b1 1.91, and 0.46 \u00b1 0.67 mm, respectively, P > 0.05.

{"Abstract": ["Chemotherapy and targeted therapy have opened new avenues in clinical oncology. However, there is a lack of response in a substantial percentage of cancer patients and diseases frequently relapse in those who even initially respond. Resistance is, at present, the major barrier to conquering cancer, the most lethal age-related pathology. Identification of mechanisms underlying resistance and development of effective strategies to circumvent treatment pitfalls thereby improving clinical outcomes remain overarching tasks for scientists and clinicians. Growing bodies of data indicate that stromal cells within the genetically stable but metabolically dynamic tumor microenvironment confer acquired resistance against anticancer therapies. Further, treatment itself activates the microenvironment by damaging a large population of benign cells, which can drastically exacerbate disease conditions in a cell nonautonomous manner, and such off-target effects should be well taken into account when establishing future therapeutic rationale. In this review, we highlight relevant biological mechanisms through which the tumor microenvironment drives development of resistance. We discuss some unsolved issues related to the preclinical and clinical trial paradigms that need to be carefully devised, and provide implications for personalized medicine. In the long run, an insightful and accurate understanding of the intricate signaling networks of the tumor microenvironment in pathological settings will guide the design of new clinical interventions particularly combinatorial therapies, and it might help overcome, or at least prevent, the onset of acquired resistance.

Therefore, we put forward a proposal for individualized hypertension management incorporating target organ damage, the main harmful effect of hypertension. We propose that hypertension should be diagnosed when an individual's blood pressure exceeds some difference from their own baseline in young adulthood, accompanied by any hypertension-induced target organ damage, confirmed by various detection methods.

Subgroup classification based on accurate prediction of prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer is important for treatment selection and clinical decision-making. The traditional method to evaluate prognosis relies on the TNM staging system, but it may not reflect the true status of every patient due to individual biological differences. Metabolomics is a field of study that involves the identification and quantification of metabolites present in a biological system. Analysis of metabolic differences between cancerous and noncancerous tissues can provide novel insights into tumor biology that are closely associated with disease prognosis and diagnosis.

Current elastic net model utilized a sure independence screening to select relevant genomic features with drug response, but it may neglect the combination effect of some marginally weak features. In this work, we applied an iterative sure independence screening scheme to select drug response relevant features from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) dataset. For each drug in CCLE, we selected up to 40 features including gene expressions, mutation and copy number alterations of cancer-related genes, and some of them are significantly strong features but showing weak marginal correlation with drug response vector. Lasso regression based on the selected features showed that our prediction accuracies are higher than those by elastic net regression for most drugs.

{"Abstract": ["Aggressive natural killer (NK) cell leukemia (ANKL) is a systemic neoplastic proliferation of NK cells with an aggressive clinical course. Currently, the diagnosis of ANKL remains challenging. In the current study, we report the clinical, laboratory, immunophenotypic, and genetic findings from 29 cases of de novo ANKL in a single center and evaluate the relative contribution of these features to the diagnosis of ANKL. Clinical features, laboratory findings, morphologic, cytogenetic features, and Epstein-Barr virus status were important factors for diagnosing aggressive NK cell leukemia. On the other hand, ANKL displays a strikingly abnormal immunophenotype in contrast to nonneoplastic NK cells. The immunophenotype of ANKL cells may differ from reactive NK cells in 4 respects. First, the CD45/linear side scatter gating of flow cytometry allows the initial identification of neoplastic subpopulations for additional immunophenotypic analysis in half of ANKL cases. Second, unusual expression of surface antigens in ANKL cells was a prominent feature. Third, the clonality of ANKL cells could be identified using antibodies against CD158a/h, CD158b, or CD158e.

{"Abstract": ["Large collections of annotated cancer cell lines are powerful tools for precisely matching targeted drugs with genomic alterations that can be tested as biomarkers in the clinic. Whether these screening platforms, which utilize short-term cell survival to assess drug responses, can be applied to precision radiation medicine is not established. To this end, 32 cancer cell lines were screened using 18 targeted therapeutic agents with known or putative radiosensitizing properties (227 combinations). The cell number remaining after drug exposure with or without radiation was assessed by nonclonogenic assays. We derived short-term radiosensitization factors (SRF2Gy) and calculated clonogenic survival assay-based dose enhancement factors (DEFSF0.1). Radiosensitization was characterized by SRF2Gy values of mostly \u223c1.05 to 1.2 and significantly correlated with drug-induced changes in apoptosis and senescence frequencies. SRF2Gy was significantly correlated with DEFSF0.1, with a respective sensitivity and specificity of 91.7% and 81.5% for a 3-day endpoint, and 82.8% and 84.2% for a robotic 5-day assay. KRAS mutations (codons 12/13) were found to be a biomarker of radiosensitization by midostaurin in lung cancer, which was pronounced under conditions that enriched for stem cell-like cells. In conclusion, although short-term proliferation/survival assays cannot replace the gold-standard clonogenic survival assay for measuring cellular radiosensitivity, they capture with high accuracy the relative change in radiosensitivity that is caused by a radiosensitzing targeted agent.", "IMPLICATIONS: ", "This study supports a paradigm shift regarding the utility of short-term assays for precision radiation medicine, which should facilitate the identification of genomic biomarkers to guide the testing of novel drug/radiation combinations."], "Citation": ["Mol Cancer Res. 2015 Apr;13(4):713-20. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-14-0570.

There is a growing consensus that radiosensitivity is a complex, inherited polygenic trait, dependent on the interaction of many genes involved in multiple cell processes. An understanding of the genes involved in processes such as DNA damage response and oxidative stress response, has evolved toward examination of how genetic variants, most often, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), may influence interindividual radioresponse. Many experimental approaches, such as candidate SNP association studies, genome-wide association studies and massively parallel sequencing are being proposed to address these questions. We present a review focusing on recent advances in association studies of SNPs to radiotherapy response and discuss challenges and opportunities for further studies.

The lack of interventional therapies prompts us to explore the therapeutic approach of targeting \u03b2-catenin signalling in MEN1-mutant PNETs. Here we show the MEN1-encoded scaffold protein menin regulates phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin. \u03b2-catenin signalling is activated in MEN1-mutant human and mouse PNETs. Conditional knockout of \u03b2-catenin suppresses the tumorigenesis and growth of Men1-deficient PNETs, and significantly prolongs the survival time in mice. Suppression of \u03b2-catenin signalling by genetic ablation or a molecular antagonist inhibits the expression of proproliferative genes in menin-null PNETs and potently improves hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia in mice. Blockade of \u03b2-catenin has no adverse effect on physiological function of pancreatic \u03b2-cells.

Establishment of a standardized tissue bank with high quality biospecimens annotated with clinical information is pivotal to the solution of these questions as well as the drug development process and translational research on glioma. Therefore, based on previous experience of tissue banks, standardized protocols for sample collection and storage were developed. We also developed two systems for glioma patient and sample management, a local database for medical records and a local image database for medical images. For future set-up of a regional biobank network in Shanghai, we also founded a centralized database for medical records. Hence we established a standardized glioma tissue bank with sufficient clinical data and medical images in Huashan Hospital. By September, 2013, tissues samples from 1,326 cases were collected.

{"Abstract": ["PEGylation (PEG) is the most commonly adopted strategy to prolong nanoparticles' vascular circulation by mitigating the reticuloendothelial system uptake. However, there remain many concerns in regards to its immunogenicity, targeting efficiency, etc., which inspires pursuit of alternate, non-PEGylated systems. We introduced here a PEG-free, porphyrin-based ultrasmall nanostructure mimicking nature lipoproteins, termed PLP, that integrates multiple imaging and therapeutic functionalities, including positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). With an engineered lipoprotein-mimicking structure, PLP is highly stable in the blood circulation, resulting in favorable pharmacokinetics and biodistribution without the need of PEG. The prompt tumor intracellular trafficking of PLP allows for rapid nanostructure dissociation upon tumor accumulation to release monomeric porphyrins to efficiently generate fluorescence and photodynamic reactivity, which are highly silenced in intact PLP, thus providing an activatable mechanism for low-background NIR fluorescence imaging and tumor-selective PDT. Its intrinsic copper-64 labeling feature allows for noninvasive PET imaging of PLP delivery and quantitative assessment of drug distribution. Using a clinically relevant glioblastoma multiforme model, we demonstrated that PLP enabled accurate delineation of tumor from surrounding healthy brain at size less than 1 mm, exhibiting the potential for intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgery and tumor-selective PDT. Furthermore, we demonstrated the general applicability of PLP for sensitive and accurate detection of primary and metastatic tumors in other clinically relevant animal models. Therefore, PLP offers a biomimetic theranostic nanoplatform for pretreatment stratification using PET and NIR fluorescence imaging and for further customized cancer management via imaging-guided surgery, PDT, or/and potential chemotherapy.

{"Abstract": ["Biomarker discovery is one of the major topics in translational biomedicine study based on high-throughput biological data analysis. Traditional methods focus on differentially expressed genes (or node-biomarkers) but ignore non-differentials. However, non-differentially expressed genes also play important roles in the biological processes and the rewired interactions / edges among non-differential genes may reveal fundamental difference between variable conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to identify relevant interactions or gene pairs to elucidate the molecular mechanism of complex biological phenomena, e.g. distinguish different phenotypes. To address this issue, we proposed a new method based on a new vector representation of an edge, EdgeMarker, to (1) identify edge-biomarkers, i.e. the differentially correlated molecular pairs (e.g., gene pairs) with optimal classification ability, and (2) transform the 'node expression' data in node space into the 'edge expression' data in edge space and classify the phenotype of each single sample in edge space, which generally cannot be achieved in traditional methods. Unlike the traditional methods which analyze the node space (i.e. molecular expression space) or higher dimensional space using arbitrary kernel methods, this study provides a mathematical model to explore the edge space (i.e. correlation space) for classification of a single sample. In this work, we show that the identified edge-biomarkers indeed have strong ability in distinguishing normal and disease samples even when all involved genes are not significantly differentially expressed. The analysis of human cholangiocarcinoma dataset and diabetes dataset also suggested that the identified edge-biomarkers may cast new biological insights into the pathogenesis of human complex diseases.

{"Abstract": ["Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide despite advances in its prevention and management. A comprehensive understanding of factors which contribute to CVD is required in order to develop more effective treatment options. Dysregulation of epigenetic posttranscriptional modifications of histones in chromatin is thought to be associated with the pathology of many disease models, including CVD. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs) are regulators of histone lysine acetylation. Recent studies have implicated a fundamental role of reversible protein acetylation in the regulation of CVDs such as hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, diabetic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, and heart failure. This reversible acetylation is governed by enzymes that HATs add or HDACs remove acetyl groups respectively. New evidence has revealed that histone acetylation regulators blunt cardiovascular and related disease states in certain cellular processes including myocyte hypertrophy, apoptosis, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. The accumulating evidence of the detrimental role of histone acetylation in cardiac disease combined with the cardioprotective role of histone acetylation regulators suggests that the use of histone acetylation regulators may serve as a novel approach to treating the millions of patients afflicted by cardiac diseases worldwide.

In particular, to ensure an appropriate evaluation of genetic evidence in parentage and forensic analyses, it is essential to have accurate estimates of the mutation rates associated with the commonly used autosomal and sex chromosome STR loci. Differences in STR mutation rates between different ethnic groups should also be determined. Mutation data from two laboratories working with different ethnic groups were extracted from many meiotic transmissions ascertained for 15 autosomal STR loci currently used in forensic routine. Forty-five thousand and eighty-five trios were checked for the biological consistency of maternity and paternity through the analysis of a minimum of 15 loci. Mutations were scored as paternal, maternal, or ambiguous according to the most parsimonious explanation for the inconsistency, using always the least requiring hypothesis in terms of number of repeat differences. The main findings are: (a) the overall mutation rate across the 15 loci was 9.78 \u00d7 10(-4) per gamete per generation (95% CI\u2009=\u20099.30 \u00d7 10(-4)-1.03 \u00d7 10(-3)), and with just 48 (out of 1,587) exceptions, all of the mutations were single-step; (b) repeat gains were more frequent than losses; (c) longer alleles were found to be more mutable; and (d) the mutation rates differ at some loci between the two ethnic groups.

{"Abstract": ["Short tandem repeat (STR) multiplexes with the amelogenin (AMEL) gene as a gender marker have been used as a routine tool of forensic DNA analysis. It has been reported that AMEL-based gender detection could misidentify a known male as a female due to the dropout of amelogenin Y (AMELY) allele. Other gender markers, such as Y-chromosomal short tandem repeat (Y-STR), may be a substitution of AMEL and help the sex determination. In current study, employing AmpFlSTR\u00ae Sinofiler and AmpFlSTR\u00ae Y-filer\u2122 PCR Amplification kit, 18 AMELY-negative males were identified. Accordingly, the incidence of the AMELY dropout was 0.227 \u2030 (18/79,304) in Chinese population. Sequencing of AMELY allele and analyzing of azoospermia factors region suggested that 3 out of 18 misidentifications were induced by mutations in the primer-binding region of the AMELY, while other 15 sex misidentifications were results of Y chromosome microdeletions with variant lengths. Moreover, variant combination patterns of AMELY dropout and Y-STRs deletions were also observed. Our data suggested that Y-STR locus dropout may indicate more problems, especially in the mixed sample's interpretation.

The variation in cardiac potassium channels is the main genetic cause of inherited long QT syndrome (LQTS), which may manifest as syncope and sudden cardiac death without structural disease. We hypothesized that cardiac potassium channel disease may be responsible for certain Chinese SUNDS cases.

Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples. A total of 2 novel non-synonymous mutations and 3 previously reported arrhythmia susceptibility polymorphisms were identified in KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, and KCNE2.

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests demonstrated no significant deviation from expected values (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) for all of the 12 X-STR loci in the Shanghai Han population. Linkage disequilibrium tests were performed for all pairs of loci by the Arlequin v3.1 software and only DXS10103-DXS10101 remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05/66).

Twenty Y-SNP loci defined 56 different haplotypes, and the haplotype diversity was estimated to be 0.9539.

{"Abstract": ["MicroRNAs (miRNAs, \u223c22 nucleotides) are small, non-protein coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. MiRNAs can express in a tissue-specific manner, and have been introduced to forensic body fluid identification. In this study, we employed the qPCR-array (TaqMan(\u00ae) Array Human MicroRNA Cards) to screen the body fluid-specific miRNAs. Seven candidate miRNAs were identified as potentially body fluid-specific and could be used as forensically relevant body fluid markers: miR16 and miR486 for venous blood, miR888 and miR891a for semen, miR214 for menstrual blood, miR124a for vaginal secretions, and miR138-2 for saliva. The candidate miRNA markers were then validated via hydrolysis probes quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan-qPCR). In addition, BestKeeper software was used to validate the expression stability of four genes, RNU44, RNU48, U6 and U6b, regularly used as reference genes (RGs) for studies involving forensic body fluids. The current study suggests that U6 could be used as a proper RG of miRNAs in forensic body fluid identification. The relative expression ratios (R) of miR486, miR888, miR214, miR16 and miR891a can differentiate the target body fluid from other body fluids that were tested in this study. The detection limit of TaqMan-qPCR of the five confirmed miRNA markers was 10pg of total RNA. The effect of time-wise degradation of blood stains and semen stains for 1 month under normal laboratory conditions was tested and did not significantly affect the detection results. Herein, this study proposes five body fluid-specific miRNAs for the forensic identification of venous blood, semen, and menstrual blood, of which miR486, miR888, and miR214 may be used as new markers for body fluid identification.

In this study, we assess a modified, more efficient method of bisulfite genomic sequencing. Genomic DNA extracted from 3-mm dried blood spots using QIAamp micro kit was treated with sodium bisulfite (using EpiTect kit). Subsequent methylation-specific PCR (MSP) followed by DNA sequencing displayed the differentially methylated region of imprinted gene SNRPN.

{"Abstract": ["MicroRNAs (miRNAs, 18-25 bases in length) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. MiRNA expression patterns, including presence and relative abundance of particular miRNA species, provide cell- and tissue-specific information that can be used for body fluid identification. Recently, two published studies reported that a number of body fluid-specific miRNAs had been identified. However, the results were inconsistent when different technology platforms and statistical methods were applied. To further study the role of miRNAs in identification of body fluids, this study sets out to develop an accurate and reliable model for data analysis of miRNA expression. To that end, the relative expression levels of three miRNAs were studied using the mirVana\u2122 miRNA Isolation Kit, high-specificity stem-loop reverse transcription (RT) and high-sensitivity hydrolysis probes (TaqMan) quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in forensically relevant biological fluids, including venous blood, vaginal secretions, menstrual blood, semen and saliva. Accurate quantification of miRNAs requires not only a highly sensitive and specific detection platform for experiment operation, but also a reproducible methodology with an adequate model for data analysis. In our study, the efficiency-calibrated model that incorporated the impact of the quantification cycle (Cq) values and PCR efficiencies of target and reference genes was developed to calculate the relative expression ratio of miRNAs in forensically relevant body fluids. Our results showed that venous blood was distinguished from other body fluids according to the relative expression ratio of miR16 using as little as 50pg of total RNA, while the expression level of miR658 was unstable and that of miR205 was nonspecific among different body fluids.

We analyzed the mean TRF length in males and females and found that males had shorter telomeres than females. Moreover, we compared the TRF length of Tibetan and Han population in China and found that telomere length did not differ between 2 populations.

Five SNPs in TYMS gene were genotyped using the Sequenom iPLEX genotyping system in a hospital-based cohort with 500 NSCLC patients, and their associations with NSCLC outcomes were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis under three genetic models (additive, dominant, and recessive models). Our data showed that there was no significant association between individual SNP and overall survival of NSCLC patients.

{"Abstract": ["Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that has a significant impact on the health care system. The reduction of glycated hemoglobin A1c is highly associated with the improvements of glycemic control and diabetic complications. In this study, we identified a traditional Chinese medicinal formula with a HbA1c-lowering potential from clinical evidences. By surveying 9,973 diabetic patients enrolled in Taiwan Diabetic Care Management Program, we found that Chu-Yeh-Shih-Kao-Tang (CYSKT) significantly reduced HbA1c values in diabetic patients. CYSKT reduced the levels of HbA1c and fasting blood glucose, and stimulated the blood glucose clearance in type 2 diabetic mice. CYSKT affected the expressions of genes associated with insulin signaling pathway, increased the amount of phosphorylated insulin receptor in cells and tissues, and stimulated the translocation of glucose transporter 4. Moreover, CYSKT affected the expressions of genes related to diabetic complications, improved the levels of renal function indexes, and increased the survival rate of diabetic mice. In conclusion, this was a translational medicine study that applied a \"bedside-to-bench\" approach to identify a novel HbA1c-lowering formula. Our findings suggested that oral administration of CYSKT affected insulin signaling pathway, decreased HbA1c and blood glucose levels, and consequently reduced mortality rate in type 2 diabetic mice.

{"Abstract": ["Laboratory animal models play an important role in the study of human diseases. Using appropriate animals is critical not only for basic research but also for the development of therapeutics and diagnostic tools. Rabbits are widely used for the study of human atherosclerosis. Because rabbits have a unique feature of lipoprotein metabolism (like humans but unlike rodents) and are sensitive to a cholesterol diet, rabbit models have not only provided many insights into the pathogenesis and development of human atherosclerosis but also made a great contribution to translational research. In fact, rabbit was the first animal model used for studying human atherosclerosis, more than a century ago. Currently, three types of rabbit model are commonly used for the study of human atherosclerosis and lipid metabolism: (1) cholesterol-fed rabbits, (2) Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, analogous to human familial hypercholesterolemia due to genetic deficiency of LDL receptors, and (3) genetically modified (transgenic and knock-out) rabbits. Despite their importance, compared with the mouse, the most widely used laboratory animal model nowadays, the use of rabbit models is still limited. In this review, we focus on the features of rabbit lipoprotein metabolism and pathology of atherosclerotic lesions that make it the optimal model for human atherosclerotic disease, especially for the translational medicine. For the sake of clarity, the review is not an attempt to be completely inclusive, but instead attempts to summarize substantial information concisely and provide a guideline for experiments using rabbits.

The conventional treatments for UC including aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants, induce remission in only half of patients. Meanwhile, the treatments often come with serious side effects which can be life-threatening. Herbal medicine, one of the most common traditional Chinese medicine modalities, has been introduced for centuries into clinical treatment of many human diseases such as infections and functional disorders. Recently, the potential effectiveness of herbs has been suggested as the treatment of UC, as shown by a variety of clinical trials and experimental studies. The herbs reported in the literature include aloe vera gel, butyrate, tormentil extracts, wheat grass juice, and curcumin. In the review, bioactivity of the herbs and their involvement in UC treatment are discussed.

A Fontan model was established in eight juvenile pigs by connecting the right atrium to the main pulmonary artery after tricuspid valve destruction. The Impella pump was inserted retrograde from the distal main pulmonary artery into the right atrium. Hemodynamics, blood gas, and echocardiographic data were compared among baseline, pure Fontan physiology (10 minutes), and mechanically assisted Fontan physiology (up to 12 hours). The Impella system generated a blood flow of 75-85 ml/kg/minute in six animals, and 55-65 ml/kg/minute in two animals. The mechanically assisted Fontan attained a significantly higher mean blood pressure (39.6 \u00b1 7 vs. 24.7 \u00b1 3.3 mm Hg, p < 0.01), lower central venous pressure (5 \u00b1 2.4 vs. 12.8 \u00b1 1.7 mm Hg, p < 0.01), and higher mixed venous saturation (60.4 \u00b1 10.8 vs. 23.4 \u00b1 8.4 mm Hg, p < 0.01) compared with pure Fontan physiology.

Substantial progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of HSCR with the help of advanced genetic analysis techniques and animal models. More than 11 genes have been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of HSCR. The RET gene is the most important susceptibility gene involved in HSCR with both coding and non- coding sequence mutations. Due to phenotypic diversity and genetic complexity observed in HSCR, mutational analysis has limited practical value in genetic counseling and clinical practice.

Failure to control appropriately for the effect of multiple testing will either result in a flood of false-positive claims or in true hits being overlooked. Cheverud proposed the idea of adjusting correlated tests as if they were independent, according to an 'effective number' (M(eff)) of independent tests. However, our experience has indicated that Cheverud's estimate of the Meff is overly large and will lead to excessively conservative results. We propose a more accurate estimate of the M(eff), and design M(eff)-based procedures to control the experiment-wise significant level and the false discovery rate. In an evaluation, based on both real and simulated data, the M(eff)-based procedures were able to control the error rate accurately and consequently resulted in a power increase, especially in multilocus analyses. The results confirm that the M(eff) is a useful concept in the error-rate control of correlated tests.

In this study we detected mutation of COL4A5 by amplifying the entire coding sequence mRNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes using nested PCR in a Chinese XLAS family, and then performed the first prenatal diagnosis of AS in China. Mutation analysis of the fetus was performed on both cDNA-based level and DNA-based level of amniocytes. Fetus sex was determined by PCR amplification of SRY and karyotypes analysis. Maternal cell contamination was excluded by linkage analysis. There was a G-to-A substitution at position 4,271 in exon 46 of COL4A5 gene (c.G4271A) in the pregnant woman; this genetic variant has not been described previously and was a novel missense mutation. The fetus did not carry the same mutation as the mother. PCR amplification product of SRY and karyotypes analysis revealed a male fetus. Linkage analysis showed that there was no contamination of maternal cells in amniocytes."], "Citation": ["Genet Test. 2008 Mar;12(1):1-7. doi: 10.1089/gte.2007.0026."], "TitleName": ["Prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling of a Chinese Alport syndrome kindred."], "AuthorsName": ["Zhang H", "1", "Ding J", "Wang F", "Yang H"], "pmid": ["18373399 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, P.

In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using a self-administered questionnaire among students at the Xiangya medical school to investigate their attitude towards genetic testing and counseling issues of FXS. We have gained a general understanding of the attitudes of medical students towards these FXS issues in China. This information is of immense importance to develop appropriate genetic tests and to train counselors for FXS. As the medical school students surveyed are prospective physicians who will be a part of the Chinese health system, our survey was focused on the basic knowledge of FXS, population-based FXS screening, confidentiality and reproductive options for mutation carriers. The study demonstrated that only less than one third of the participants had heard about FXS. 94.6\u00a0% of participants were in favor of FXS screening for women in their reproductive age who had a genetic history of FXS. Furthermore, only half of the participants would inform their families about their genetic status in case of positive test results, and more than half of the participants supported natural conception and prenatal diagnosis for FXS mutation carriers.

{"Abstract": ["The analysis of complex DNA mixtures is challenging for forensic DNA testing. Accurate and sensitive methods for profiling these samples are urgently required.

A strong linear correlation was detected between the peak height (PH) and peak area (PA) in the curve fit using the least squares method (P<2e-16). The Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test revealed significant differences in the heterozygote balance ratio (H(b)) at 16 short tandem repeat (STR) loci (P=0.0063) and 9 mixed gradients (P=0.02257). Locally weighted regression fitting of APH and Hb (inflection point at APH = 1,250 rfu) showed 92.74% of H(b) >0.6 with the APH \u22651,250. The variation of H(b) distribution in the different STR loci suggested the different forensic efficiencies of these loci. Allelic drop-out (ADO) correlated with the APH and mixed gradient.

{"Abstract": ["Sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS) remains an enigma to both forensic pathologists and physicians. Previous epidemiological, clinical, and pilot genetic studies have implicated that SUNDS is most likely a disease allelic to Brugada syndrome (BrS). We have performed postmortem genetic testing to address the spectrum and role of genetic abnormalities in the SCN5A-encoded cardiac sodium channel and its several associated proteins in SUNDS victims from Southern China. Genomic DNA extracted from the blood samples of 123 medico-legal autopsy-negative SUNDS cases and 104 sex-, age- and ethnic-matched controls from Southern China underwent comprehensive amino acid coding region mutational analysis for the BrS associated genes SCN5A, SCN1B, SCN2B, SCN3B, SCN4B, MOG1, and GPD1-L using PCR and direct sequencing. We identified a total of 7 unique (4 novel) putative pathogenic mutations (all in SCN5A; V95I, R121Q [2 cases], R367H, R513H, D870H, V1764D, and S1937F) in 8/123 (6.5%) SUNDS cases. Three SCN5A mutations (V95I, R121Q, and R367H) have been previously implicated in BrS. An additional 8 cases hosted rare variants of uncertain clinical significance (SCN5A: V1098L, V1202M, R1512W; SCN1B: V138I [3 cases], T189M [2 cases]; SCN3B: A195T). There were no non-synonymous mutations found in SCN2B, SCN4B, MOG1, or GPD1-L. This first comprehensive genotyping for SCN5A and related genes in the Chinese Han population with SUNDS discovered 13 mutations, 4 of them novel, in 16 cases, which suggests cardiac sodium channel dysfunction might account for the pathogenesis of 7-13% of SUNDS in Southern China.

{"Abstract": ["The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the Goldeneye 20A system (containing 19 short tandem repeats) can avert the shortage of duo parentage tests. Among routine cases typed by the Identifiler system, we identified 42 motherless cases, 2 fatherless cases, and 34 trio cases containing 1 locus mismatch and 4 motherless cases with 2 locus mismatches. One true trio case was rejected by fatherhood testing because of the omission of the mother's genotype and because the genotype of the putative father matched that of the child. All of the cases were retyped by the Goldeneye 20A system with the mother's or father's sample. In total, 39 motherless cases were verified by one mutation, 3 motherless cases were rejected for paternity, and 4 motherless cases with 2 locus mismatches were ruled out by fatherhood testing. After adding the father's genotype, 1 motherless case was confirmed by a single-locus mutation, whereas another case was rejected by motherhood testing. The mutation and exclusion rates detected with the Goldeneye 20A system accorded with the corresponding rates identified in the Identifiler system.

Accumulating evidence indicates that aging resembles a developmentally regulated process tightly controlled by specific age-associated methylation exists in human genome. This study isolated and identified eight gene fragments in which the degree of cytosine methylation is significantly correlated with age in blood of 40 donors. Furthermore, we validated two CpG sites of each gene fragment and replicated our results in a general population sample of 40 males and 25 females with a wide age-range (11-72 years). The methylation of these fragments is linear with age over a range of six decades (Fragment P1 (r=-0.64), P2 (r=-0.58), P3 (r=-0.79), R1 (r=0.82), R2 (r=0.63), R3 (r=0.59), R4 (r=0.63) and R5 (r=0.62)). Using average methylation of two CpG sites from each fragment, we built a regression model that explained 95% of the variance in age and is able to predict the age of an individual with great accuracy (R(2)=0.918). The predicted values are highly correlated with the observed age in the sample (r=0.91). This study implicates that DNA methylation will be an available biological marker of age-prediction.

These results ushered in the era of multimodal therapy for rectal cancer, heralding modern treatment and changing the standard of care in the United States. We have seen many advances over the past 3 decades, including optimization of the administration and timing of radiation, widespread adoption of total mesorectal excision (TME), and the implementation of more effective systemic chemotherapy. The current standard is neoadjuvant chemoradiation with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and a radiosensitizer, TME, and adjuvant chemotherapy including 5-FU and oxaliplatin. The results of this regimen have been impressive, with a reported local recurrence rate of less than 10%. However, the rates of distant relapse remain 30% to 40%, indicating room for improvement. In addition, trimodality therapy is arduous and many patients are unable to complete the full course of treatment.

{"Abstract": ["Abnormal gene expression in cancer represents an under-explored source of cancer markers and therapeutic targets. In order to identify gene expression signatures associated with survival in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a strategy was designed to search for aberrant gene activity, which consists of applying several filters to transcriptomic datasets from two pediatric ALL studies. Six genes whose expression in leukemic blasts was associated with prognosis were identified:three genes predicting poor prognosis (AK022211, FASTKD1 and STARD4) and three genes associated with a favorable outcome (CAMSAP1, PCGF6 and SH3RF3). Combining the expression of these 6 genes could successfully predict prognosis not only in the two discovery pediatric ALL studies, but also in two independent validation cohorts of adult patients, one from a publicly available study and one consisting of 62 newly recruited Chinese patients. Moreover, our data demonstrate that our six gene based test is particularly efficient in stratifying MLL or BCR.ABL negative patients.

{"Abstract": ["DNA polymerases without the 3' exonuclease function (exo(-) pol) have been widely used in sequencing and SNP genotyping. As a major player that expedited the coming of the postgenomic era, exo(-) polymerases worked remarkably well in the Human Genome Sequencing Project. However, it has become a challenge for this class of polymerases to efficiently screen the large number of SNPs that are found in the human genome. For more than three decades it has been recognized that polymerase fidelity varied according to the presence of proofreading activity that is mediated by its internal 3' exonuclease. Polymerases with proofreading function are famous for their high fidelity in DNA replication both in vivo and in vitro, but this well-known class of polymerases has been almost completely neglected in genetic analysis in the postgenomic era. We speculate that exo(+) polymerases may exhibit higher nucleotide identification ability when compared to exo- polymerases for an in vitro genetic analysis. With the application of exo(+) polymerases in SNP assays, a novel mechanism for the maintenance of DNA replication, the on/off switch, was discovered. Two new SNP assays have been developed to carry out genome-wide genotyping, taking advantage of the enzymatic properties of exo(+) polymerases. Furthermore, the on/off switch mechanism embodies a powerful nucleotide identification ability, which can be used to discriminate the bases that are upstream of the 3' terminus, and thus defines a new concept in de novo sequencing technology. Application of exo(+) polymerases to genetic analysis, and especially SNP assays, will greatly accelerate the pace to personalized medicine."], "Citation": ["J Biochem Mol Biol. 2004 May 31;37(3):269-74."], "TitleName": ["New performance from an old member: SNP assay and de novo sequencing mediated by exo+ DNA polymerases."], "AuthorsName": ["Zhang J", "1", "Li K"], "pmid": ["15469706 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "Genomapping Inc., Tianjin, China. jia34@yahoo.com."], "email": [], "FullTextLink": ["http://www.jbmb.or.kr/fulltext/jbmb/view.php?vol=37&page=269"]},

From the beginning of constitution of Chinese medicine, clinical application has been given priority. Therefore, the idea of translational medicine is fully demonstrated in the research into the three key scientific problems of \"classification of constitution of Chinese medicine\", \"relationship between constitution and disease\" and \"adjustment of constitution\". Under its guidance, not only was the systematic theory of constitution of Chinese medicine established, but also the Constitution of Chinese Medicine Scale and the Standards of Classification and determination of Constitution of Chinese Medicine were developed, which translates methods of classifying the nine constitutional types into guidance for prevention of disease, management of health and clinical application. The research findings of constitution of Chinese medicine have been applied in clinical practice and public health, establishing the diagnosis and treatment model of constitution-disease-syndrome differentiation. The nationwide application of constitution differentiation has shown good effect. In the future, constitution of Chinese medicine should strengthen the evidence-based research and multi-disciplinary cooperation, and establish a research team on comprehensive constitution of Chinese medicine and translational medicine, to translate the findings into clinical practice and public health more accurately and quickly.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated after 8\u00a0minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation and continued for an additional 8\u00a0minutes. The myocardial function and the serum concentrations of troponin I (Tn I) and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured at baseline and after resuscitation. After resuscitation, both Tn I and NT-proBNP were significantly increased in all groups, especially in the epinephrine and epinephrine pretreated with \u03b12-blocker groups. Significantly better PR myocardial function and neurologic deficit score were observed in epinephrine pretreated with the \u03b11- or \u03b2-blocker with decreased releases of Tn I and NT-proBNP. However, the most significant improvements were observed in the animals pretreated with \u03b2- plus \u03b11-blocker.

The workshop aimed at addressing culture- and context-specific genetic counseling/consultation practices in South-East Asia. As a way of contextualizing genetic counseling/consultation in South-East Asia, we first offer an overview of communication-oriented research generally, drawing attention to consultation and counseling as part of a communicative continuum with distinctive interactional features. We then provide examples of genetic counseling/consultation research in Hong Kong. As other countries in South-East Asia have not yet embarked on communication-oriented empirical research, we report on the current practices of genetic counseling/consultation in these countries in order to identify similarities and differences as well as key obstacles that could be addressed through future research. Three issues emerged as 'problematic': language, religion and culture.

{"Abstract": ["In 2003, a panel of experts published a set of consensus guidelines for the delineation of the neck node levels in node negative patients (Radiother Oncol, 69: 227-36, 2003). In 2006, these guidelines were extended to include the characteristics of the node positive and the post-operative neck (Radiother Oncol, 79: 15-20, 2006). These guidelines did not fully address all nodal regions and some of the anatomic descriptions were ambiguous, thereby limiting consistent use of the recommendations. In this framework, a task force comprising opinion leaders in the field of head and neck radiation oncology from European, Asian, Australia/New Zealand and North American clinical research organizations was formed to review and update the previously published guidelines on nodal level delineation. Based on the nomenclature proposed by the American Head and Neck Society and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and in alignment with the TNM atlas for lymph nodes in the neck, 10 node groups (some being divided into several levels) were defined with a concise description of their main anatomic boundaries, the normal structures juxtaposed to these nodes, and the main tumor sites at risk for harboring metastases in those levels. Emphasis was placed on those levels not adequately considered previously (or not addressed at all); these included the lower neck (e.g. supraclavicular nodes), the scalp (e.g. retroauricular and occipital nodes), and the face (e.g. buccal and parotid nodes). Lastly, peculiarities pertaining to the node-positive and the post-operative clinical scenarios were also discussed. In conclusion, implementation of these guidelines in the daily practice of radiation oncology should contribute to the reduction of treatment variations from clinician to clinician and facilitate the conduct of multi-institutional clinical trials.

{"Abstract": ["Human cancers are endowed with sustained vascularization capability, and their growth, invasion, and metastasis are vascularization dependent. Recently, accumulated body of evidence suggests that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can support vasculogenesis and induce angiogenesis through paracrine mechanisms. In addition, numerous clinical studies have revealed the increase in the number of EPCs in the peripheral blood of cancer patients and demonstrated the correlation of circulating EPCs (CEPCs) with the clinical outcomes. This review highlights current enrichment procedures and methods for the detection of CEPCs and different biomarkers to identify CEPCs as well as the functions of EPCs in tumor vascularization. Furthermore, we systematically review available studies on the clinical relevance of CEPCs in cancer patients to explore the potential diagnostic and prognostic values of CEPCs. Although several contrasting results exist, CEPCs can conceivably serve as a promising biomarker for the early diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and treatment response indication in the future. Additionally, further well-designed clinical studies with larger sample size and unique, specific enumeration procedures are warranted to achieve further insight into the clinical implications of CEPCs.

{"Abstract": ["A combination of four-dimensional computed tomography with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (4D CT-FDG PET) was used to delineate gross tumor volume (GTV) in esophageal cancer (EC). Eighteen patients with EC were prospectively enrolled. Using 4D images taken during the respiratory cycle, the average CT image phase was fused with the average FDG PET phase in order to analyze the optimal standardized uptake values (SUV) or threshold. PET-based GTV (GTV(PET)) was determined with eight different threshold methods using the auto-contouring function on the PET workstation. The difference in volume ratio (VR) and conformality index (CI) between GTV(PET) and CT-based GTV (GTV(CT)) was investigated. The image sets via automatic co-registrations of 4D CT-FDG PET were available for 12 patients with 13 GTV(CT) values.

Diverse drugs have been removed from the market owing to their inhibitory activity on the hERG channel and their contribution to acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS). Moreover, mutations that cause hERG channel dysfunction may induce congenital LQTS. Recently, an increasing number of biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying hERG-associated LQTS have been reported. In fact, numerous potential biochemical and molecular rescue strategies are hidden within the biogenesis and regulating network.

{"Abstract": ["Accurate segmentation of the prostate is the key to the success of external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer. However, accurate segmentation of the prostate in computer tomography (CT) images remains challenging mainly due to three factors: (1) low image contrast between the prostate and its surrounding tissues, (2) unpredictable prostate motion across different treatment days and (3) large variations of intensities and shapes of the bladder and rectum around the prostate. In this paper, an online-learning and patient-specific classification method based on the location-adaptive image context is presented to deal with all these challenging issues and achieve the precise segmentation of the prostate in CT images. Specifically, two sets of location-adaptive classifiers are placed, respectively, along the two coordinate directions of the planning image space of a patient, and further trained with the planning image and also the previous-segmented treatment images of the same patient to jointly perform prostate segmentation for a new treatment image (of the same patient). In particular, each location-adaptive classifier, which itself consists of a set of sequential sub-classifiers, is recursively trained with both the static image appearance features and the iteratively updated image context features (extracted at different scales and orientations) for better identification of each prostate region. The proposed learning-based prostate segmentation method has been extensively evaluated on 161 images of 11 patients, each with more than nine daily treatment three-dimensional CT images. Our method achieves the mean Dice value 0.908 and the mean \u00b1 SD of average surface distance value 1.40 \u00b1 0.57 mm.

{"Abstract": ["Particle irradiation started to draw attention in the past decade and has now become a hotspot in the radiation oncology community. This article reviews the most advanced developments in particle irradiation, focusing on the characteristics of proton and carbon ions in radiation physics and radiobiology. The Bragg peak of physical dose distribution causes proton and carbon beams to optimally meet the requirement for cancer irradiation because the Bragg peak permits the accurate concentration of the dose on the tumor, thus sparing the adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, carbon ion has more radiobiological benefits than photon and proton beams. These benefits include stronger sterilization effects on intrinsic radio-resistant tumors and more effective killing of hypoxic, G(0), and S phase cells. Compared with the most advanced radiation techniques using photon, such as three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy, proton therapy has yielded more promising outcomes in local control and survival for head and neck cancers, prostate carcinoma, and pediatric cancers. Carbon therapy in Japan showed even more promising results than proton therapy. The local controls and overall survivals were as good as that treated by surgery in early stages of non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, and head and neck cancers, especially for such highly resistant tumors as melanoma. The non-invasive nature of particle therapy affords more patients with chances to receive and benefit from treatment. Particle therapy is gradually getting attention from the oncology community.

{"Abstract": ["A growing number of multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has undergone testing for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unfortunately, this enthusiasm has recently been discouraged by a number of negative phase III studies on several anti-angiogenic TKIs in HCC. Several postulations have been made to account for this phenomenon, namely the plateau effects of anti-angiogenesis approach, the heterogeneity of HCC in terms of background hepatitis/cirrhosis and tumor biology, as well as the way how clinical trials are designed. Regardless of the underlying reasons, these results suggested that alternative strategies are necessary to further develop systemic therapy for HCC. Several new strategies are currently evaluated: for examples, molecular agents with activities against targets other than vascular endothelial growth factor receptor are being evaluated in on-going clinical trials. In addition, different approaches of targeted agents in combination with various treatment modalities, such as concurrently with another molecular agent, cytotoxic chemotherapy or transarterial chemoembolization, are being developed. This review aims to give a summary on the results of recently released clinical trials on TKIs, followed by discussion on some of the potential novel agents and combinational approaches.

T-cell lymphomas are more prevalent in Asia than in Europe and North America, and NK-cell lymphomas occur almost exclusively in Asia and South America.

Because T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas are more prevalent in Asia, the establishment of management recommendations by Asian oncologists in collaboration with international experts is pertinent. This review outlines guidelines commensurate with different levels of health-care resources and expertise.

The expressing plasmid, p4-1BBL, was constructed and was used to treat established melanoma in situ model and metastasis tumor model mice, respectively, with injecting directly into the skeletal muscle of the inoculation site and systemically administering plasmid with the hydrodynamics-based gene-delivery approach. Administration of p4-1BBL resulted in high-level expression in the muscle and liver. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with 4-1BBL plasmid DNA significantly suppressed the growth and metastasis of melanoma without significant toxicity, compared with mice treated with control-plasmid DNA. This treatment with plasmid p4-1BBL in vivo induced an infiltration of CD8(+) T-cells into the tumor milieu and an increase of levels of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma.

{"Abstract": ["Chemotherapy, the treatment modality of choice for advanced cancers, is considered immunosuppressive due to its depletion of immune cells. Hence, chemotherapy is traditionally thought to adversely affect anti-tumor immune responses and antagonistic to tumor immunotherapy. Contrary to conventional belief, recent studies have shown that combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy resulted in enhanced anti-tumor immunity and improved therapeutic outcome. The mechanisms by which the use of chemotherapy paradoxically benefits immunotherapy await elucidation. CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) are a lymphocyte subset which plays a crucial role in inhibiting tumor-reactive effector cell functions and suppressing anti-tumor immunity. We hypothesize that chemotherapy benefits immunotherapy by preferentially impairing Treg, in effect eliminating immunosuppressive elements and augmenting the immune function of anti-tumor effector cells. Clarification of how chemotherapy exerts its immunomodulatory effects will aid in the development of better combination strategies of chemoimmunotherapy in the treatment of cancer."], "Citation": ["Med Hypotheses. 2008 Nov;71(5):802-4. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2008.06.022.

Given that thermosensitive hydrogels have been widely investigated for controlled delivery based on their phase transition, we speculate that nanoparticles with the novel polymers play a key role in tumor therapy respond to thermal activity. Therefore, we here hypothesize that enhanced delivery of therapeutics might be achieved by conjugation to thermosensitive polymers, in concert with targeted hyperthermia by precisely specifying the phase transition temperature of the thermosensitive polymer.

{"Abstract": ["Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer death, particularly in Asia where the major etiology, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, is endemic. The tumor frequently develops in a background of cirrhosis, and liver transplantation offers a chance to cure both the tumor and the underlying cirrhosis. The Milan criteria based on tumor size and number as an estimate of tumor burden are conventionally the gold standard in determining eligibility for transplantation, and the outcome is excellent. The shortage of organs from deceased donors has curtailed the adoption of extended criteria and led to the problems of long waiting times and dropouts. Several measures have been taken to tackle these issues, including prioritization of patients with HCC, use of pretransplant adjuvant treatment to prevent tumor progression, and living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). With a high incidence of HCC and a low organ donation rate, Asia has developed a distinctive pattern of indication and strategy in the application of liver transplantation. Over the last decade, the number of liver transplants in Asia has increased rapidly, by 10-fold, largely as a result of the development of LDLT. The proportion of patients who undergo liver transplantation for HCC is increasing and HCC comprises one third of the indication for liver transplantation in Asia. LDLT is the dominant strategy, accounting for 96% of the liver transplants for HCC. Many transplant programs accept patients beyond the Milan criteria, and the reported 3-year survival rate is about 60%. With the promotion of organ donation, better quantification of the benefit of LDLT for extended indications, and identification of predictors for survival, the practice of liver transplantation for HCC in Asia will continue to evolve."], "Citation": ["Oncologist. 2007 Nov;12(11):1321-31."], "TitleName": ["Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma in Asia."], "AuthorsName": ["de Villa V", "1", "Lo CM"], "pmid": ["18055852 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "Department of Surgery, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, 102 Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China."], "email": [], "FullTextLink": ["http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18055852"]},

{"Abstract": ["The purpose of the study is to evaluate the 10 years follow-up of the efficacy in Chinese patients receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin/epirubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP) regimen as the initial treatment for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We have retrospectively analyzed 437 patients with DLBCL who were newly diagnosed and received CHOP or R-CHOP regimen in six university hospitals and closely followed up after the completion of treatment. For all patients, there were significant differences between R-CHOP and CHOP for overall survival (OS) (median follow-up 86 months, 84.1% vs 70.2%, p = 0.018) and progression-free survival (PFS) (81.5% vs 66.7%, p = 0.015), while elder patients (>60 years old) received higher OS (median follow-up 66 months, 80.7% vs 53.0%, p = 0.011). But for younger patients (\u226460 years old), the treatments with rituximab did not demonstrate a significant effect on OS (85.5% vs 79.4%, p = 0.428). In the R-CHOP group, International Prognostic Index (IPI) distinguished three risk groups instead of four risk groups. But in the CHOP group, IPI still distinguished four risk groups. Furthermore, for 212 of 437 patients diagnosed with extranodal involvement DLBCL, R-CHOP regimen provided a longer OS than CHOP regimen did (OS, 89.9% vs 71.7%, p = 0.014). Moreover, patients with extranodal lymphoma had a significant longer survival in rituximab era (OS, 89.9% vs 79.2% for extranodal and nodal, respectively; p = 0.048). The results of this large-scale study suggested that R-CHOP provided a greater survival benefit in the initial treatment of DLBCL.

Intestinal microbiota has long been considered to implicate in colorectal cancer pathology; and many recent reports point out a close linkage between the intestinal bacteria and the genesis of the tumor. Present studies indicate that the structure and characteristics of the intestinal microbiota are significantly altered in colorectal cancer, precancerous lesion, and high risk population compared with healthy controls and low risk population. Based on the current studies and theories, we postulate monitoring the intestinal bacterial profile by the molecular methods that could fulfill the ultraearly prediction about the degree of the risk developing into colorectal cancer.

Importantly, RVs in the CDS of these two genes are also associated with the disorder. To assess independent and joint effects between the different types of RET and NRG1 variants identified in HSCR patients, we used 254 Chinese sporadic HSCR patients and 143 ethnically matched controls for whom the RET and/or NRG1 variants genotypes (rare and common) were available. Four genetic risk factors were defined and interaction effects were modeled using conditional logistic regression analyses and pair-wise Kendall correlations. Our analysis revealed a joint effect of RET CVs with RET RVs, NRG1 CVs or NRG1 RVs. To assess whether the genetic interaction translated into functional interaction, mouse neural crest cells (NCCs; enteric neuron precursors) isolated from embryonic guts were treated with NRG1 (ErbB2 ligand) or/and GDNF (Ret ligand) and monitored during the subsequent neural differentiation process.

In this study, we use the concept of haplotype blocks to evaluate the coverage of five SNP sets including the HapMap and four commercial arrays, for every exon in the human genome. We show that although some Chips can reach similar coverage as the HapMap, only about 50% of exons are completely covered by haplotype blocks of HapMap SNPs.

In the present study,             we elucidated the status of oncology research from 2001 to 2010. Studies published             in 30 representative oncology journals were retrieved from the Web of Science             (2001-2010) to compose our dataset. Knowledge domain visualisation, co-citation             analysis and social network analysis methods were used. By mapping the oncology             research performed from 2001 to 2010, we identified the primary research centres,             including the top 20 institutions and countries and the 4 major oncology research             fronts: i)\u00a0the mechanism of abnormal oncogene expression; ii) tumour metastasis             and angiogenesis; iii) the relationship between cancer cells and apoptosis; and             iv) tumour vaccines. We also identified the 36 most collaborative academic communities,             and multiple myeloma, angiogenesis and acute lymphocytic leukaemia were found             to be the focuses of collaborative research in oncology from 2001 to 2010.

Current pathway association studies primarily focus on single important disease phenotype, which is sometimes insufficient to characterize the clinical manifestations of complex diseases.

In our approach, PCA is first applied to multiple correlated quantitative phenotypes for extracting a set of orthogonal phenotypic components. The extracted phenotypic components are then used for pathway association analysis instead of original quantitative phenotypes. Four statistics were proposed for PCA-based MPPAS in this study. Simulations using the real data from the HapMap project were conducted to evaluate the power and type I error rates of PCA-based MPPAS under various scenarios considering sample sizes, additive and interactive genetic effects. A real genome-wide association study data set of bone mineral density (BMD) at hip and spine were also analyzed by PCA-based MPPAS. Simulation studies illustrated the performance of PCA-based MPPAS for identifying the causal pathways underlying complex diseases.

Polymorphisms in nucleotide excision repair genes may cause variations in DNA repair capacity phenotype and thus contribute to cancer risk. In this case-control study of 1,125 gastric cancer cases and 1,196 cancer-free controls, we investigated the association between three functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs2296147T > C, rs2094258C > T and rs873601G > A) in the xeroderma pigmentosum group G (XPG) gene and gastric cancer risk. We used the Taqman assays to genotype these three SNPs and logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We found that only the rs873601A variant genotypes were associated with a significant higher risk for gastric adenocarcinoma (adjusted OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.03-1.64 for AA vs. GG and adjusted OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.01-1.49 for AA vs. GG/AG).

All these were not found for the other two SNPs (rs2296147T > C and rs2094258C > T). We then performed expression analysis using gastric cancer adjacent normal tissues from 141 patients and found that the A variant allele was associated with non-significantly reduced expression of XPG mRNA (P(trend) = 0.107). Further analysis using mRNA expression data from the HapMap suggested that the A allele was associated with significantly reduced expression of XPG mRNA in normal cell lines for 45 Chinese (P(trend) = 0.003) as well as for 261 subjects with different ethnicities (P(trend) = 0.001).

{"Abstract": ["The dimension of the population genetics data produced by next-generation sequencing platforms is extremely high. However, the \"intrinsic dimensionality\" of sequence data, which determines the structure of populations, is much lower. This motivates us to use locally linear embedding (LLE) which projects high dimensional genomic data into low dimensional, neighborhood preserving embedding, as a general framework for population structure and historical inference. To facilitate application of the LLE to population genetic analysis, we systematically investigate several important properties of the LLE and reveal the connection between the LLE and principal component analysis (PCA). Identifying a set of markers and genomic regions which could be used for population structure analysis will provide invaluable information for population genetics and association studies. In addition to identifying the LLE-correlated or PCA-correlated structure informative marker, we have developed a new statistic that integrates genomic information content in a genomic region for collectively studying its association with the population structure and LASSO algorithm to search such regions across the genomes. We applied the developed methodologies to a low coverage pilot dataset in the 1000 Genomes Project and a PHASE III Mexico dataset of the HapMap. We observed that 25.1%, 44.9% and 21.4% of the common variants and 89.2%, 92.4% and 75.1% of the rare variants were the LLE-correlated markers in CEU, YRI and ASI, respectively.

Four htSNPs (rs6966, rs2070830, rs4802252, and rs4803817) representing 95% of the common variations in PPP1R13L, as well as fourteen htSNPs encompassing ERCC2, PPP1R13L, and ERCC1 on chromosome 19q13.3 were explored. Three haplotype blocks of strong linkage disequilibrium were identified. Overall, no single htSNP or haplotype associations were found for PPP1R13L. Highly significant differential distributions of haplotypes defined by both nine htSNPs covering ERCC2 and PPP1R13L and fourteen htSNPs covering ERCC2, PPP1R13L, and ERCC1 were found (global test P = 8.12e-005 and P = 4.82e-006, respectively).

{"Abstract": ["Haplotypes can provide significant information in many research fields, including molecular biology and medical therapy. However, haplotyping is much more difficult than genotyping by using only biological techniques. With the development of sequencing technologies, it becomes possible to obtain haplotypes by combining sequence fragments. The haplotype reconstruction problem of diploid individual has received considerable attention in recent years. It assembles the two haplotypes for a chromosome given the collection of fragments coming from the two haplotypes. Fragment errors significantly increase the difficulty of the problem, and which has been shown to be NP-hard. In this paper, a fast and accurate algorithm, named FAHR, is proposed for haplotyping a single diploid individual. Algorithm FAHR reconstructs the SNP sites of a pair of haplotypes one after another. The SNP fragments that cover some SNP site are partitioned into two groups according to the alleles of the corresponding SNP site, and the SNP values of the pair of haplotypes are ascertained by using the fragments in the group that contains more SNP fragments. The experimental comparisons were conducted among the FAHR, the Fast Hare and the DGS algorithms by using the haplotypes on chromosome 1 of 60 individuals in CEPH samples, which were released by the International HapMap Project. Experimental results under different parameter settings indicate that the reconstruction rate of the FAHR algorithm is higher than those of the Fast Hare and the DGS algorithms, and the running time of the FAHR algorithm is shorter than those of the Fast Hare and the DGS algorithms. Moreover, the FAHR algorithm has high efficiency even for the reconstruction of long haplotypes and is very practical for realistic applications.

{"Abstract": ["Our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Hong Kong Southern Chinese population with extreme bone mineral density (BMD) scores revealed suggestive association with MPP7, which ranked second after JAG1 as a candidate gene for BMD. To follow-up this suggestive signal, we replicated the top single-nucleotide polymorphism rs4317882 of MPP7 in three additional independent Asian-descent samples (n= 2684). The association of rs4317882 reached the genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis of all available subjects (P(meta)= 4.58 \u00d7 10(-8), n= 4204). Site heterogeneity was observed, with a larger effect on spine than hip BMD. Further functional studies in a zebrafish model revealed that vertebral bone mass was lower in an mpp7 knock-down model compared with the wide-type (P= 9.64 \u00d7 10(-4), n= 21). In addition, MPP7 was found to have constitutive expression in human bone-derived cells during osteogenesis. Immunostaining of murine MC3T3-E1 cells revealed that the Mpp7 protein is localized in the plasma membrane and intracytoplasmic compartment of osteoblasts. In an assessment of the function of identified variants, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated the binding of transcriptional factor GATA2 to the risk allele 'A' but not the 'G' allele of rs4317882. An mRNA expression study in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirmed that the low BMD-related allele 'A' of rs4317882 was associated with lower MPP7 expression (P= 9.07 \u00d7 10(-3), n= 135).

Resolving the relationships among genetic structure, seasonal breeding-related mating systems and dispersal will facilitate our understanding of the evolution of inbreeding avoidance. The goals of this study were as follows: (i) to determine whether females actively avoided mating with relatives in a group-living rodent species, Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii), by combined analysis of their mating system, dispersal and genetic structure; and (ii) to analyze the relationships among the variation in fine-genetic structure, inbreeding avoidance, season-dependent mating strategies and individual dispersal. Using both individual- and population-level analyses, we found that the majority of Brandt's vole groups consisted of close relatives. However, both group-specific FISs, an inbreeding coefficient that expresses the expected percentage rate of homozygosity arising from a given breeding system, and relatedness of mates showed no sign of inbreeding. Using group pedigrees and paternity analysis, we show that the mating system of Brandt's voles consists of a type of polygyny for males and extra-group polyandry for females, which may decrease inbreeding by increasing the frequency of mating among distantly-related individuals. The consistent variation in within-group relatedness, among-group relatedness and fine-scale genetic structures was mostly due to dispersal, which primarily occurred during the breeding season.

{"Abstract": ["The study on time-dependent expression of \u03b17 nicotine acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR) was performed by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time PCR during skeletal muscle wound healing in rats. Furthermore, co-localization of \u03b17nAChR with macrophage or myofibroblast marker was detected by double immunofluorescence. A total of 50 Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into control and contusion groups (3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 10 days, and 14 days post-injury). In the uninjured controls, \u03b17nAChR positive staining was observed in the sarcolemma and sarcoplasm of normal myofibers. In wounded specimens, a small number of polymorphonuclear cells, a number of macrophages and myofibroblasts showed positive reaction for \u03b17nAChR in contused zones. Morphometrically, the average ratios of \u03b17nAChR-positive cells were over 50 % from 3 to 10 days after contusion, and exceeded 60 % at 5 and 7 days post-injury. Besides, the positive ratios of \u03b17nAChR were <50 % at the other posttraumatic intervals. By Western blotting analysis, the average ratio of \u03b17nAChR protein expression maximized at 7 days after injury, which was >2.13. Similarly, the relative quantity of \u03b17nAChR mRNA expression peaked at 7 days post-wounding as compared with control by real-time PCR detection, showing a relative quantity of >2.65. In conclusion, the expression of \u03b17nAChR is upregulated and temporally distributed in macrophages and myofibroblasts during skeletal muscle wound healing, which might be closely involved in inflammatory response and fibrotic repair after injury. Moreover, \u03b17nAChR is promising as a useful marker for wound age determination of skeletal muscle."], "Citation": ["Int J Legal Med. 2014 Sep;128(5):779-86. doi: 10.1007/s00414-014-1001-5.

{"Abstract": ["Cell-based biosensors (CBBs) have emerged as promising biotechnical tools whereby various cell types can be used as basic sensing units to detect external stimuli. Specifically, CBBs have been applied in environmental monitoring, drug screening, clinical diagnosis and biosecurity. For these applications, CBBs offer several advantages over conventional molecular-based biosensors or living animal-based approaches, such as the capability to better mimic physiological situations, to enhance detection specificity and sensitivity, and to detect unknown compounds and toxins. On the other hand, existing CBBs suffer from several limitations, such as weak cell-substrate attachment, two-dimensional (2D) cell microenvironment, and limited shelf life. An emerging method for scaffold-free three-dimensional (3D) cell culture uses hydrogels to encapsulate cells. Advances in novel biomaterials and nano/microscale technologies have enabled encapsulation of cells in hydrogels to fabricate 3D CBBs, which hold great potential for addressing the limitation in existing 2D CBBs.

{"Abstract": ["Previous studies suggested that serum catecholamines are useful for investigating stress responses in the death process. The present study analyzed postmortem urinary adrenaline (Ad), noradrenaline (Nad) and dopamine (DA) in serial forensic autopsy cases (n=199: 154 males and 45 females; age >9years; survival time <0.5-168h; within 10days postmortem) to investigate the differences among the causes of death with special regard to hyperthermia (heatstroke; n=11) and hypothermia (cold exposure; n=10); other cases included fatalities from injury (n=47), mechanical asphyxiation (n=18), drowning (n=14), intoxication (n=31), fire fatality (n=33) and natural death (n=35). Each catecholamine level in urine was independent of the age or gender of the subjects, postmortem interval over 10days or survival time, and did not correlate with the blood level. Urinary Adr and Nad levels were similar to those of clinical serum reference ranges, while DA was higher in all cases. Adr and Nad were higher in blunt head injury, methamphetamine abuse, hypothermia (cold exposure) and hyperthermia (heat stroke), but were low in mechanical asphyxia, drowning, fire fatality, sedative-hypnotic intoxication and acute cardiac death. DA was higher in injury, drowning, fire fatality, methamphetamine abuse and acute cardiac death, but was lower in mechanical asphyxiation and sedative-hypnotic intoxication. These profiles were quite different from those of serum levels, involving a predominant increase of DA, and may be useful for differentiating hyperthermia (heatstroke) and hypothermia (cold exposure) from drowning, sedative-hypnotic intoxication and sudden cardiac death.

The various experimental results on various datasets show that the running time of our method is less than GTagger and MLR. And MACA can find the most representative SNPs for haplotyping, so that MACA is more stable and the number of tag SNPs is also smaller than other evolutionary methods (like GTagger and NSGA-II).

Twenty-five forensic autopsies of unexpected sudden death in individuals with OSA were reviewed. The causes of death were as follows: cardiomyopathy (n\u00a0=\u00a011); sudden unexpected death without morphologic findings (SUDNA, n\u00a0=\u00a06); and other cardiovascular diseases not related to OSA (n\u00a0=\u00a08). The cardiomyopathy group comprised five hearts with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy without dilatation and six with left ventricular diameter >4\u00a0cm (dilated cardiomyopathy). Four of six hearts in the SUDNA group showed right ventricular dilatation compared with seven of 11 showed cardiomyopathy and one of eight miscellaneous. The degree of obesity was greatest in the dilated cardiomyopathy group (10 of 11 obese) followed by the SUDNA group (four of six obese). The cardiac findings in patients dying suddenly and unexpectedly with OSA include nonspecific cardiomyopathy, other cardiac conditions, and hearts without a morphologic cause of death, which show frequent right ventricular dilatation as the only finding.

The present study investigated the molecular pathology of brain damage and responses involving brain edema in forensic autopsy cases of fire fatality (n\u2009=\u200955) compared with sudden cardiac death (n\u2009=\u200911), mechanical asphyxia (n\u2009=\u200913), and non-brain injury cases (n\u2009=\u200922). Postmortem mRNA and immunohistochemical expressions of aquaporins (AQPs), claudin5 (CLDN5), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were examined. Prolonged deaths due to severe burns showed an increase in brain water content, but relative mRNA quantification, using different normalization methods, showed inconsistent results: in prolonged deaths due to severe burns, higher expression levels were detected for all markers when three previously validated reference genes, PES1, POLR2A, and IPO8, were used for normalization, higher for AQP1 and MMP9 when GAPDH alone was used for normalization and higher for MMP9, but lower for MMP2 when B2M alone was used for normalization. Additionally, when B2M alone was used for normalization, higher expression of AQP4 was detected in acute fire deaths. Furthermore, the expression stability values of these five reference genes calculated by geNorm demonstrated that B2M was the least stable one, followed by GAPDH. In immunostaining, only AQP1 and MMP9 showed differences among the causes of death: they were evident in most prolonged deaths due to severe burns.

Napsin A is expressed in the lung and kidney and is an alternative marker for pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Arginase A is a sensitive and specific marker for liver tumors. ERG (Ets-related gene) is an excellent marker for endothelium and vascular tumors as well as prostatic cancer (about 50% of cases). SOX10 (SRY-related HMG box) is expressed predominantly in melanocytic and Schwann cells and the corresponding tumors.

{"Abstract": ["The elucidation and prediction of the biomechanics of lower limb fractures could serve as a useful tool in forensic practices. Finite element (FE) analysis could potentially help in the understanding of the fracture mechanisms of lower limb fractures frequently caused by car-pedestrian accidents. Our aim was (1) to develop and validate a FE model of the human lower limb, (2) to assess the biomechanics of specific injuries concerning run-over and impact loading conditions, and (3) to reconstruct one real car-pedestrian collision case using the model created in this study. We developed a novel lower limb FE model and simulated three different loading scenarios. The geometry of the model was reconstructed using Mimics 13.0 based on computed tomography (CT) scans from an actual traffic accident. The material properties were based upon a synthesis of data found in published literature. The FE model validation and injury reconstruction were conducted using the LS-DYNA code. The FE model was validated by a comparison of the simulation results of three-point bending, overall lateral impact tests and published postmortem human surrogate (PMHS) results. Simulated loading scenarios of running-over the thigh with a wheel, the impact on the upper leg, and impact on the lower thigh were conducted with velocities of 10 m/s, 20 m/s, and 40 m/s, respectively. We compared the injuries resulting from one actual case with the simulated results in order to explore the possible fracture bio-mechanism. The peak fracture forces, maximum bending moments, and energy lost ratio exhibited no significant differences between the FE simulations and the literature data. Under simulated run-over conditions, the segmental fracture pattern was formed and the femur fracture patterns and mechanisms were consistent with the actual injury features of the case.

{"Abstract": ["This case concerns a sudden death of a patient with Chiari I malformation. A 17-year-old female was seen unconscious then fell off a motorbike during the vehicle acceleration. The girl was confirmed dead on the way to hospital, being previously asymptomatic and with a clean medical record. Autopsy findings showed an extremely extra-long cerebellar tonsillar herniation in the left side and unexplained multiple small cavities in cerebral hemispheres. Microscopic findings revealed loss and abnormal migration of the Purkinje cells, as well as capillary congestion in the herniated tonsil. The cause and mechanisms of this sudden death are considered as the cardiopulmonary dysfunction and arrest resulted from compression of the medulla and cervical cord, which was induced by both the positional insult and minor head trauma. In addition, this study stresses the importance of cervical cord examination in the case of unexpected sudden death following road accidents.

{"Abstract": ["Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD) are the most commonly inherited neuromuscular disease. However, accurate and convenient molecular diagnosis cannot be achieved easily because of the enormous size of the dystrophin gene and complex causative mutation spectrum. Such traditional methods as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification plus Sanger sequencing require multiple steps to fulfill the diagnosis of DMD/BMD. Here, we introduce a new single-step method for the genetic analysis of DMD patients and female carriers in real clinical settings and demonstrate the validation of its accuracy. A total of 89 patients, 18 female carriers and 245 non-DMD patients were evaluated using our targeted NGS approaches. Compared with traditional methods, our new method yielded 99.99% specificity and 98.96% sensitivity for copy number variations detection and 100% accuracy for the identification of single-nucleotide variation mutations. Additionally, this method is able to detect partial deletions/duplications, thus offering precise personal DMD gene information for gene therapy. We detected novel partial deletions of exons in nine samples for which the breakpoints were located within exonic regions. The results proved that our new method is suitable for routine clinical practice, with shorter turnaround time, higher accuracy, and better insight into comprehensive genetic information (detailed breakpoints) for ensuing gene therapy.

This is a bottleneck for monitoring HIV epidemic trends and evaluating the effectiveness of national AIDS control programs. Several serological methods were used to address this issue with some success. Because of high false-positive rates in patients with advanced infection or in ART treatment, UNAIDS still hesitates to recommend their use in routine surveillance. We developed a new pattern-based method for measuring intra-patient viral genetic diversity for determination of recent infections and estimation of population incidence. This method is verified by using several datasets (424 subtype B and 77 CRF07_BC samples) with clearly identified HIV-1 infection times. Pattern-based diversities of recent infections are significantly lower than that of chronic ones. With larger window periods varying from 200 to 350 days, a higher accuracy (90%-95%) not affected by advanced disease nor ART treatment could be obtained.

In paired sample experiments (N=19), the quantity of DNA extracted by hydrothermal pressure treatment was comparable to that obtained through the conventional xylene deparaffinization and protease K digestion method. The integrity of the recovered DNA was also comparable, evidenced by polymerase chain reaction amplifications of variable-sized amplicons in tissue samples archived from 0.2 to 22 years (N=14). The high quality of DNA was further confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and Sanger sequencing analysis of representative exons of the EGFR gene in human non-small cell lung cancer tissue samples.

Recently, high throughput data such as microarray data together with bioinformatics methods have become a powerful way to identify biomarkers and to investigate pathogenesis of diseases. Taking advantage of well characterized microarray datasets of NASH livers, we performed a systematic analysis of potential biomarkers and possible pathological mechanism of NASH from a bioinformatics perspective.CodeLink Human Whole Genome Bioarrays were analyzed to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between controls and NASH patients. Four methods were used to identify DEGs and the intersection of DEGs identified by these methods was subsequently used for both biomarker prediction and molecular pathological mechanism analysis. For biomarker prediction, rank aggregation was used to rank DEGs identified by all these methods according to their significance of different expression. Alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (ADH4) exhibited the highest rank suggesting the most significant differential expression between normal and disease condition. Together with the previous report demonstrating the association between ADH4 and the pathogenesis of NASH, our data suggest that ADH4 could be a potential biomarker for NASH. For molecular pathological mechanism analysis, two clusters of highly correlated annotation terms and genes in these terms were identified based on the intersection of DEGs. Then, pathways enriched with these genes were identified to construct the network. Using this network, both for the first time, amino acid catabolism is implicated to play a pivotal role and urea cycle is implicated to be involved in the development of NASH.The results of our study identified potential biomarkers and suggested possible molecular pathological mechanism of NASH.

In the normal lung tissue, we found that multiphoton imaging could display normal lung parenchyma composed of alveolar spaces separated by thin septa. In the cancerous lung tissue, multiphoton imaging clearly illustrated that cancer cells displayed marked cellular and nuclear pleomorphism. These cancer cells were characterized by irregular size and shape, enlarged nuclei, and increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. All of these histopathological features of tissue architecture and cell morphology identified by multiphoton images were readily correlated with H-E staining images.

Traditional approaches for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis include etiological, immunological and imaging techniques. Diagnosis of schistosomiasis has been revolutionized by the advent of new molecular technologies to amplify parasite nucleic acids.

{"Abstract": ["The goal of this study was to examine the pathophysiological changes to erythrocytes in multiple myeloma (MM) patients at a nanometer scale. We hypothesize that studying changes in red blood cells may be important for early diagnosis and effective treatment of MM. Blood samples were taken from ten healthy volunteers and ten MM patients before and after treatment. Changes in the morphological and biomechanical properties of the erythrocytes were studied at a nanometer scale with atomic force microscopy (AFM). There were dramatic deformations in the overall shape and surface membrane of the erythrocytes from pre- and post therapeutic MM patients compared with the healthy controls. Healthy and pathological MM erythrocytes could be distinguished by several morphologic parameters, including the width, length, length to width ratio, valley, peak, valley-to-peak, standard deviation, and surface fluctuation. The effectiveness of disease treatment could also be evaluated by studying these red blood cell parameters. AFM was able to detect noticeable morphological differences in the red blood cells from MM patients compared with healthy controls. Therefore, erythrocyte morphology is an important parameter for diagnosing MM, as well as evaluating the efficacy of disease treatment."], "Citation": ["Scanning. 2012 Sep-Oct;34(5):295-301. doi: 10.1002/sca.21008.

This paper describes the particular analyses of the transcriptome of human lung tissue that was infected by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Random primers were used to produce ESTs from total RNA samples of the lung tissue. The result showed a high diversity of the transcripts, covering much of the human genome, including loci which do not contain protein coding sequences. 10,801 ESTs were generated and assembled into 267 contigs plus 7,659 singletons. Sequences matching to SARS-CoV RNAs and other pneumonia-related microbes were found. The transcripts were well classified by functional annotation. Among the 7,872 assembled sequences that were identified as from human genome, 578 non-coding genes were revealed by BLAST search. The transcripts were mapped to the human genome with the restriction of identity=100%, which found a candidate pool of 448 novel transcriptional loci where EST transcriptional signal was never found before. Among these, 13 loci were never reported to be transcriptional by other detection methods such as gene chips, tiling arrays, and paired-end ditags (PETs).

The present study quantitatively investigated the number of astrocytes that showed GFAP- and S100-protein immunopositivity in the cerebral white matter and hippocampus at the sites distant from primary injury with regard to survival time, complication, and the immediate cause of death of brain injury cases. Autopsy cases of brain injury (8-48 h postmortem) comprising acute/subacute deaths (survival time, <3/6 h-3 days; n=27/42) and delayed deaths (survival time >3 days) with/without complications (n=30/22) were examined. Delayed death cases with complications were subdivided into those in which the immediate cause of death had been determined as cerebral dysfunction (n=22) and those that had been determined as due to fatal complications (n=8). For controls, natural deaths from pneumonias (n=12) and sudden cardiac deaths (n=27) were used. In brain injury cases, the numbers of astrocytes in the cerebral white matter and hippocampal CA4 region were significantly lower for subacute death and delayed death without complications (p<0.05-0.001). Delayed death with fatal complications showed a significant increase in the number of astrocytes (p<0.05). Among delayed death cases, the numbers of astrocytes were higher in the cases with fatal complications than in those without complications and with non-fatal complications, although the latter cases showed large variations in the numbers of these astrocytes. These findings suggest that critical brain injury causes acute death without evident astrocyte pathology and that subacute death is associated with progressive brain damage accompanied by an astrocyte loss.

{"Abstract": ["The significance of focal myocardial inflammation in sudden death is poorly understood, because there are few studies addressing its frequency in noncardiac and cardiac arrhythmic deaths. We prospectively assessed inflammation in 384 consecutive hearts seen in consultation from a single medical examiners' office. Hearts were received intact and sectioned uniformly in five areas and reviewed histologically by a single pathologist. Intrinsic inflammatory diseases of the myocardium were excluded. Infiltrates were classified as lymphocytic without necrosis, lymphocytic with myocyte necrosis, and eosinophilic. Histologic findings were retrospectively correlated with other cardiac findings, history of drug and medication use, postmortem toxicology, and cause of death. In the 384 hearts, any infiltrate was found in 18%. There were multifocal infiltrates in 9%, inflammation with necrosis in 2%, and eosinophilic myocarditis in 4%. Infiltrates were most frequent in natural noncardiac deaths (31%), and least frequent in traumatic deaths (12%). Infiltrates with myocyte necrosis occurred in 4% of arrhythmic deaths with no other cause, 3% of cardiac deaths with cardiomegaly, 3% of traumatic deaths, 2% of natural noncardiac deaths, 2% of other cardiac deaths, and 1% of coronary deaths. Infiltrates were common in patients on antibiotics (54%) or neuroleptic drugs (27%). Eosinophilic infiltrates were especially common in patients on antibiotics (18%).

Similar to the xylene-processed paraffin blocks, the SBO-processed counterparts were easy to section without any evidence of cell shrinkage. Assessment of the SBO-treated sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin revealed a good maintenance of cell morphology and structure, and a clear definition of the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Moreover, comparable good results were achieved between the SBO- and xylene-processed tissues in other histochemical and immunohistochemical stainings. Six-month clinical applications at one department of pathology supported the potentials of SBO as a xylene substitute. In conclusion, we suggest that SBO is a safe and efficient substitute of xylene and may probably replace xylene without losing valuable diagnostic information.

{"Abstract": ["Death due to accidental electrocution occurs frequently. The aim of this study was to investigate alterations in cardiac connexin 43 (Cx43), angiotensin II (Ang II), endothelin 1 (ET-1), and type III collagen associated with fatal electrocution.Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control, fatal electrocution (220 V, 50 Hz, 60 seconds), and electrical injury (220 V, 50 Hz, 60 seconds) groups. Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital before each treatment, with the anode connected to the left foreleg and the cathode to the right hindleg, followed by cervical dislocation. Control animals received cervical dislocation alone. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate the cardiac protein expression of Cx43, Ang II, ET-1, and type III collagen. Sections were analyzed by digital image analysis.The expression of Cx43 was significantly reduced after fatal electrocution, with the integrated optical density also lower when compared with control (P < 0.05). Expression of both Ang II and ET-1 was significantly increased after fatal electrocution, supported by integrated optical density when compared with control (P < 0.05). But no significant difference was found in type III collagen expression between the fatal electrocution group and the control group.In summary, cardiac protein expression of Cx43, Ang II, and ET-1 was found to be significantly altered with fatal electrocution, suggesting that these 3 proteins may be important underlying mechanisms of death during fatal electrocution.

To date, the relationship between circulating miRNAs and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) caused varicella has not been reported. Using TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) analysis, expression levels of miRNAs in serum samples from 29 patients with varicella and 60 patients with Bordetella pertussis (BP), measles virus (MEV) and enterovirus (EV) were analyzed. The array results showed that 247 miRNAs were differentially expressed in sera of the varicella patients compared with healthy controls (215 up-regulated and 32 down-regulated). Through the following qRT-PCR confirmation and receiver operational characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, five miRNAs (miR-197, miR-629, miR-363, miR-132 and miR-122) were shown to distinguish varicella patients from healthy controls and other microbial infections with moderate sensitivity and specificity.

{"Abstract": ["Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers in developed countries. On the other hand, CRC is also one of the most curable cancers if it is detected in early stages through regular colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Since CRC develops slowly from precancerous lesions, early detection can reduce both the incidence and mortality of the disease. Fecal occult blood test is a widely used non-invasive screening tool for CRC. Although fecal occult blood test is simple and cost-effective in screening CRC, there is room for improvement in terms of the accuracy of the test. Genetic dysregulations have been found to play an important role in CRC development. With better understanding of the molecular basis of CRC, there is a growing expectation on the development of diagnostic tests based on more sensitive and specific molecular markers and those tests may provide a breakthrough to the limitations of current screening tests for CRC. In this review, the molecular basis of CRC development, the characteristics and applications of different non-invasive molecular biomarkers, as well as the technologies available for the detection were discussed. This review intended to provide a summary on the current and future molecular diagnostics in CRC and its pre-malignant state, colorectal adenoma.

{"Abstract": ["Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein and its precursor, amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (\u03b2-APP), have traditionally been used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Their use in diagnosis of traumatic brain injury by forensic analysis is becoming more widespread. However, to date, no reliable small animal model exists to evaluate these brain injury indicators. To address this, we have studied primary brain-stem injury in rats to assess the appearance of diffuse axonal injury in brain sections and correlate these findings with appearance of A\u03b2 and relative \u03b2-APP mRNA levels. Using an EnVision 2-step immunohistochemical staining method to measure axon diameter, we found that there was significant difference in axon diameters within the medulla oblongata and several time points after brain injury, ranging from 3 to 24 hours. In addition, mRNA expression levels of \u03b2-APP increased following brain injury, peaking 3 hours following injury and decreasing back to baseline levels by 24 hours after injury. These results suggest that using immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to detect changes in A\u03b2-associated axonal changes and \u03b2-APP mRNA levels, respectively, can be useful for the diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury during autopsy at early time points following fatal brain injury.

{"Abstract": ["Molecular biomarkers could detect biochemical changes associated with disease processes. The key metabolites have become an important part for improving the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of diseases. Because of the chemical diversity and dynamic concentration range, the analysis of metabolites remains a challenge. Assessment of fluctuations on the levels of endogenous metabolites by advanced NMR spectroscopy technique combined with multivariate statistics, the so-called metabolomics approach, has proved to be exquisitely valuable in human disease diagnosis. Because of its ability to detect a large number of metabolites in intact biological samples with isotope labeling of metabolites using nuclei such as H, C, N, and P, NMR has emerged as one of the most powerful analytical techniques in metabolomics and has dramatically improved the ability to identify low concentration metabolites and trace important metabolic pathways. Multivariate statistical methods or pattern recognition programs have been developed to handle the acquired data and to search for the discriminating features from biosample sets. Furthermore, the combination of NMR with pattern recognition methods has proven highly effective at identifying unknown metabolites that correlate with changes in genotype or phenotype. The research and clinical results achieved through NMR investigations during the first 13 years of the 21st century illustrate areas where this technology can be best translated into clinical practice.

{"Abstract": ["The importance of determining postmortem interval (PMI) is crucial to criminal, civil and forensic cases. The precise estimation of PMI is a critical step in many death investigations. A technique exploiting the level of RNA, 18S rRNA and microRNA to estimate PMI was investigated. 18S-rRNA is a main ribosomal RNA presented as part of the ribosomal protein complex, while microRNA is a class of small non-coding single-stranded RNA, only 21-25 nucleotides, which has a strong conservation between different species. In this study, heart tissues were removed from adult rats at various postmortem intervals. An efficient extraction and detection protocol to analyze the level of 18S-rRNA and microRNA in postmortem tissue was carried out. The process consists of total RNA extraction, transcription and visualization by quantitative real time PCR. The result indicates a characteristic parabola relationship between postmortem period and Ct values for 18S-rRNA in dead rat hearts. The result indicates that the degradation pattern of tissue 18S-rRNA and microRNA is useful in the determination of the postmortem interval within seven days.

{"Abstract": ["Fine-needle aspiration biopsy remains the mainstay for preoperative examination of thyroid nodules; however, it does not provide a definite diagnosis in up to 25% of nodules. Considerable studies have been performed to identify molecular markers to resolve this diagnostic dilemma. The aim of this study was to establish the distribution and frequency of common genetic alterations in a comprehensive set of benign and malignant thyroid nodules, and to determine the feasibility and role of testing for a panel of genetic alterations in improving the accuracy of cytology diagnosis in a Chinese population. This study was conducted in 314 thyroid nodules comprising 104 papillary thyroid carcinomas, 13 suspicious nodules, 52 indeterminate nodules, and 145 benign nodules. Point mutations and RET/PTC rearrangements, were evaluated by pyrosequencing and TaqMan real-time PCR, respectively. After surgery, 115 nodules were confirmed as conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma and 102 (88.70%) of these nodules harbored either the BRAF(V600E) mutation (76.52%) or RET/PTC rearrangements (12.17%). RAS mutation was found in 1 (33.33%) follicular thyroid carcinoma, 1 (14.29%) follicular thyroid adenoma and 4 (10%) goiter nodules. With cytology and molecular testing, the diagnostic accuracy was further increased to 98.82% in papillary thyroid carcinoma diagnosis, and was preoperatively increased to 76.92% and 84.00%, respectively, in nodules with suspicious and indeterminate cytology. In conclusion, molecular testing of a panel of genetic alterations in fine-needle aspiration biopsy can be effectively performed in clinical practice. It enhances the accuracy of cytology and is of particular value for indeterminate nodules in the Chinese population.

In this study, we aimed to determine the methylation status of TGR5 promoter in patients with acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACHBLF) and its predictive value for prognosis. We enrolled 76 consecutive ACHBLF patients, 80 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs). Methylation status of TGR5 promoter in peripheral mononuclear cell (PBMC) was detected by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). The mRNA level of TGR5 was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We found that the frequency of TGR5 promoter methylation was significantly higher in ACHBLF (35/76, 46.05%) than CHB patients (5/80, 6.25%; \u03c7(2) = 32.38, P < 0.01) and HCs (1/30, 3.33%; \u03c7(2) = 17.50, P < 0.01).

{"Abstract": ["Noninvasive prenatal testing using fetal DNA in maternal plasma is an actively researched area. The current generation of tests using massively parallel sequencing is based on counting plasma DNA sequences originating from different genomic regions. In this study, we explored a different approach that is based on the use of DNA fragment size as a diagnostic parameter. This approach is dependent on the fact that circulating fetal DNA molecules are generally shorter than the corresponding maternal DNA molecules. First, we performed plasma DNA size analysis using paired-end massively parallel sequencing and microchip-based capillary electrophoresis. We demonstrated that the fetal DNA fraction in maternal plasma could be deduced from the overall size distribution of maternal plasma DNA. The fetal DNA fraction is a critical parameter affecting the accuracy of noninvasive prenatal testing using maternal plasma DNA. Second, we showed that fetal chromosomal aneuploidy could be detected by observing an aberrant proportion of short fragments from an aneuploid chromosome in the paired-end sequencing data. Using this approach, we detected fetal trisomy 21 and trisomy 18 with 100% sensitivity (T21: 36/36; T18: 27/27) and 100% specificity (non-T21: 88/88; non-T18: 97/97). For trisomy 13, the sensitivity and specificity were 95.2% (20/21) and 99% (102/103), respectively. For monosomy X, the sensitivity and specificity were both 100% (10/10 and 8/8). Thus, this study establishes the principle of size-based molecular diagnostics using plasma DNA.

{"Abstract": ["Fatal fat embolism is usually considered a sequel to long-bone fracture, although uncommon cases secondary to soft tissue injury and trauma have been reported. We present the case of a 42-year-old male drug addict who sustained multiple blunt traumatic injuries without skeletal fractures but in whom pulmonary fat embolisms were identified. External examination of the body and forensic autopsy revealed severe, widespread soft tissue hemorrhaging (on approximately 30% of the body surface area) of the limbs, although the thoracic and abdominal viscera were intact. Histological examination of the Sudan III-stained sections of the lungs revealed orange drop-shaped and branching fat emboli. The right and left coronary arteries had signs of moderate atherosclerosis. Toxicological screening of a blood sample revealed a methamphetamine level of 1.05 \u03bcg/mL. We concluded that the immediate cause of death was pulmonary fat embolism, that the primary cause of death is the blunt force trauma, and that methamphetamine abuse and coronary atherosclerosis were contributory. A literature review revealed that the pathophysiologic basis for fat embolism in the absence of any fracture is perhaps a consequence of acutely increased pressure at the trauma site and altered emulsification of blood lipids during shock. This case reminds forensic scientists to consider fat embolism as a cause of death in cases of blunt force injury without fracture. In addition, these patients must be closely monitored while still alive, with other relevant clinical factors identified for better therapeutic effect, thereby decreasing the mortality rate.

Succinylcholine (Sch) is a short-acting neuromuscular blocker medically used to achieve complete relaxation of muscle for a good intubation condition. Without the help of an artificial respirator, intramuscular injection of a large dose of Sch can paralyze the respiratory muscle and result in the receiver's death. In this paper, we present the homicide case of a young male killed by Sch from a syringe-like dart ejected by a compound crossbow. The subcutaneous and muscular hemorrhages observed around the entry were more severe than that caused by a medical injection. Additionally, other autopsy results showed the external appearance of a pinhole, general asphyxia signs and pathological findings which were not characteristic. The discovery of a syringe-like dart at the scene is the critical clue and reason for analyzing for Sch, which is commonly used to load syringe-like dart to paralyze and steal dog in the countryside of China.

{"Abstract": ["Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that is clinically classified into several subtypes. Among these subtypes, basal-like breast cancer largely overlaps with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and these two groups are generally studied together as a single entity. Differences in the molecular makeup of breast cancers can result in different treatment strategies and prognoses for patients with different breast cancer subtypes. Compared with other subtypes, basal-like and other ER+ breast cancer subtypes exhibit marked differences in etiologic factors, clinical characteristics and therapeutic potential. Anthracycline drugs are typically used as the first-line clinical treatment for basal-like breast cancer subtypes. However, certain patients develop drug resistance following chemotherapy, which can lead to disease relapse and death. Even among patients with basal-like breast cancer, there can be significant molecular differences, and it is difficult to identify specific drug resistance proteins in any given patient using conventional variance testing methods. Therefore, we designed a new method for identifying drug resistance genes. Subgroups, personalized biomarkers, and therapy targets were identified using cluster analysis of differentially expressed genes. We found that basal-like breast cancer could be further divided into at least four distinct subgroups, including two groups at risk for drug resistance and two groups characterized by sensitivity to pharmacotherapy. Based on functional differences among these subgroups, we identified nine biomarkers related to drug resistance: SYK, LCK, GAB2, PAWR, PPARG, MDFI, ZAP70, CIITA and ACTA1. Finally, based on the deviation scores of the examined pathways, 16 pathways were shown to exhibit varying degrees of abnormality in the various subgroups, indicating that patients with different subtypes of basal-like breast cancer can be characterized by differences in the functional status of these pathways. Therefore, these nine differentially expressed genes and their associated functional pathways should provide the basis for novel personalized clinical treatments of basal-like breast cancer.

We determined the level of atorvastatin in plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. With the endogenous molecules, which showed a good correlation with pharmacokinetic parameters, a refined partial least-squares model was calculated based on predose data from a training set of 36 individuals and exhibited good predictive capability for the other 12 individuals in the prediction set. In addition, the model was successfully used to predictively classify individual pharmacokinetic responses into subgroups. Metabolites such as tryptophan, alanine, arachidonic acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, cholesterol, and isoleucine were indicated as candidate markers for predicting by showing better predictive capability for explaining individual differences than a conventional physiological index.

{"Abstract": ["Polycomb group (PcG) proteins Ring1B and EZH2, which have been characterized as catalyzing the two epigenetic modifications H2AK119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119Ub1) and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27Me3), are well-known epigenetic silencers implicated in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. However, the status of polycomb-associated histone modifications and their clinical implications in pancreatic cancer remain unclear. Here, we performed immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 80 pairs of human pancreatic cancer specimens to assess the expression levels of Ring1B, H2AK119Ub1, EZH2, and H3K27Me3 in tumors. More than 50% of the tumor cells showed a high expression of H2AK119Ub1, Ring1B, and EZH2, whereas more than 50% of the tumor cells showed a low level of H3K27Me3. Different expression patterns of H2AK119Ub1 and H3K27Me3 in tumors were negatively correlated (r = -0.247, P = 0.027). Both H2AK119Ub1 and H3K27Me3 independently predicted the clinical prognosis. In particular, a combinatorial pattern of elevated H2AK119Ub1 and decreased H3K27Me3 in tumors was significantly correlated with a poorer prognosis. Furthermore, compared to the tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) staging system, histone modifications can discriminate the survival difference more accurately, especially for patients with stage I or stage II tumors. Simultaneous silencing of Ring1B and EZH2 via shRNA depleted H2AK119Ub1 and H3K27Me3 in the pancreatic cancer cells PanC1 and AsPC1, enhanced HOX gene derepression, and inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro and in tumor xenograft models. These results demonstrated that H2AK119Ub1 and H3K27Me3 cooperate in tumors and are associated with the clinical prognosis in combinatorial patterns.

Substantial progress has been made in molecular diagnosis and personalized treatment of the disease. The field is now moving towards multiple new directions to include (1) new generation of targeted agents such as epidermal growth factor receptor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors to overcome resistance to their early generation counterparts; and (2) deeper understanding of tumor genetics of each individual patient and consequently the application of biomarkers to guide personalized treatment as well as novel drug development including combination therapy. The increasing capacity in innovative cancer drug research and development is supported by extensive collaboration within China and globally, and across academia and industry, to build up expertise and infrastructure in early-phase clinical testing of novel drugs.

The spectrum nature of brain disorders and the importance of pathogenetic linkage among various disordered domains or endophenotypes have also been recognized as an important strategic direction of translational research. Here, we discuss cross-domain analyses of animal models, and focus on their value for mimicking the clinical overlap between disordered neurobehavioral domains in humans.

A novel method detecting the promoter methylation status of O\u2076-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in tissue samples by a fluorescence polarization assay was developed. A pair of primers was used to amplify a 266 bp fragment in the promoter region of the O\u2076-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene. Two probes specific for either methylated or unmethylated DNA labeled with different fluorophores hybridized with their target amplicons, and the hybridization increased the fluorescence polarization values.

Ninety-seven glioma tumor samples were analyzed in parallel with the new assay and the nested gel-based methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay. The results of the methylation status of the fluorescence polarization assay were in good concordance with the results obtained with the nested gel-based methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay.

In this study, we firstly used the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)-based screening approach to isolate a male-specific DNA fragment and thereby identified a 10,569 bp of male-specific sequence and a 10,365 bp of female-related sequence by genome walking in the bagrid catfish, in which a substantial genetic differentiation with 96.35 % nucleotide identity was revealed between them. Subsequently, a high differentiating region of 650 bp with only 70.26 % nucleotide identity was found from the corresponding two sequences, and three primer pairs of male-specific marker, male and female-shared marker with different length products in male and female genomes, and female-related marker were designed. Significantly, when these markers were used to identify genetic sex of the bagrid catfish, only male individuals was detected to amplify the male-specific marker fragment, and female-related marker was discovered to produce dosage association in females and in males.

{"Abstract": ["The evolution and current distribution of the Sino-Tibetan flora have been greatly affected by historical geological events, such as the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), and Quaternary climatic oscillations. Rhodiola kirilowii, a perennial herb with its distribution ranging from the southeastern QTP and the Hengduan Mountains (HM) to adjacent northern China and central Asia, provides an excellent model to examine and disentangle the effect of both geological orogeny and climatic oscillation on the evolutionary history of species with such distribution patterns. We here conducted a phylogeographic study using sequences of two chloroplast fragments (trnL-F and trnS-G) and internal transcribed spacers in 29 populations of R. kirilowii. A total of 25 plastid haplotypes and 12 ITS ribotypes were found. Molecular clock estimation revealed deep divergence between the central Asian populations and other populations from the HM and northern China; this split occurred ca. 2.84 million year ago. The majority of populations from the mountains of northern China were dominated by a single haplotype or ribotype, while populations of the HM harbored both high genetic diversity and high haplotype diversity. This distribution pattern indicates that HM was either a diversification center or a refugium for R. kirilowii during the Quaternary climatic oscillations. The present distribution of this species on mountains in northern China may have resulted from a rapid glacial population expansion from the HM. This expansion was confirmed by the mismatch distribution analysis and negative Tajima's D and Fu's FS values, and was dated to ca. 168 thousand years ago. High genetic diversity and population differentiation in both plastid and ITS sequences were revealed; these imply restricted gene flow between populations. A distinct isolation-by-distance pattern was suggested by the Mantel test. Our results show that in old lineages, populations may harbour divergent genetic forms that are sufficient to maintain or even increase overall genetic diversity despite fragmentation and low within-population variation.

Here we describe a haplotyping approach using two simple techniques: polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and haplotype-specific PCR. In this approach, individual regions of a gene are analyzed by PCR-SSCP to identify variation that defines sub-haplotypes, and then extended haplotypes are assembled from the sub-haplotypes either directly or with the additional use of haplotype-specific PCR amplification. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by haplotyping ovine FABP4 across two variable regions that contain seven SNPs and one indel.

The T-RFLP profiles revealed an influence of growth year of the host plant on fungal endophyte communities in rhizomes of this plant species; whereas, the geographic location where A. officinarum was grown contributed to only limited variation in the fungal endophyte communities of the host tissue. Furthermore, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis across all of the rhizome samples showed that the fungal endophyte community assemblages in the rhizome samples could be grouped according to the presence of two types of active indicator chemicals: total volatile oils and galangin. Our present results, for the first time, address a diverse fungal endophyte community is able to internally colonize the rhizome tissue of A. officinarum. The diversity of the fungal endophytes found in the A. officinarum rhizome appeared to be closely correlated with the accumulation of active chemicals in the host plant tissue. The present study also provides the first systematic overview of the fungal endophyte communities in plant rhizome tissue using a culture-independent method.

{"Abstract": ["The Chinese traditional chrysanthemum is a notable group of chrysanthemums (Chrysanthemum\u00d7morifolium Ramat.) in which the phenotypic characteristics richly vary. At present, there is a serious controversy regarding homonyms and synonyms within this group. Moreover, the current international chrysanthemum classification systems are not comprehensive enough to be used on Chinese traditional chrysanthemums. Thus, we first identified a broad collection of 480 Chinese traditional chrysanthemum cultivars using the unique DNA fingerprints and molecular identities that were established by 20 simple sequence repeat markers. Five loci, which distinguished all of the selected cultivars, were identified as the core loci to establish unique fingerprints and molecular identities with 19 denary digits for each cultivar. A cluster analysis based on Nei's genetic distance indicated that the selected cultivars were clustered according to their horticultural classification. Population structure analysis was subsequently performed with K values ranging from 2 to 14, and the most likely estimate for the population structure was ten subpopulations, which was nearly consistent with the clustering result. Principal component analysis was further performed to verify the classification results. On the basis of the Q-matrices of K\u200a=\u200a10, a total of 19 traits were found to be associated with 42 markers. Taken together, these results can serve as starting points for the identification and classification of chrysanthemums based on the polymorphism of microsatellite markers, which is beneficial to promote the marker-assisted breeding and international communication of this marvelous crop.

{"Abstract": ["Two-component systems (TCSs) have been reported to exhibit a sensing and responding role under drug stress that induces drug resistance in several bacterial species. However, the relationship between TCSs and multidrug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has not been comprehensively analysed to date. In this study, 90 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates were analysed using 15-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU)-variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) typing and repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep)-PCR-based DNA fingerprinting. The results showed that all of the isolates were of the Beijing lineage, and strains with a drug-susceptible phenotype had not diverged into similar genotype clusters. Expression analysis of 13 response regulators of TCSs using real-time PCR and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) proteomic analysis demonstrated that four response regulator genes (devR, mtrA, regX3 and Rv3143) were significantly upregulated in multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains compared with the laboratory strain H37Rv as well as drug-susceptible and isoniazid-monoresistant strains (P<0.05). DNA sequencing revealed that the promoter regions of devR, mtrA, regX3 and Rv3143 did not contain any mutations. Moreover, expression of the four genes could be induced by most of the four first-line antitubercular agents. In addition, either deletion or overexpression of devR in Mycobacterium bovis BCG did not alter its sensitivity to the four antitubercular drugs. This suggests that upregulation of devR, which is common in MDR-TB strains, might be induced by drug stress and hypoxic adaptation following the acquisition of multidrug resistance.

In the present study, cryo-injury to shoot tips and genetic stability in regenerants recovered from cryopreserved shoot tips by the three vitrification-based protocols were further investigated. The results showed that sucrose preculture caused no obviously different injuries, while dehydration with plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS2) was the step causing major damage to cells of shoot tips, regardless of the cryogenic procedures. Compared with droplet-vitrification and encapsulation-vitrification, vitrification caused the most severe injury to cells of the shoot tips, thus resulting in much longer time duration for shoot recovery and much lower shoot regrowth rate. Cells in apical dome and the youngest leaf primordia were able to survive and subsequently some of them regrew into shoots following all three vitrification-based cryopreservation procedures. Analyses using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers in shoots regrown from all three vitrification-based protocols did not find any polymorphic bands.

Developmental validation indicated that the 26plex Y-STRs typing system was reproducible, accurate, sensitive and robust. The sensitivity of the system was such that a full profile was obtainable even with 125pg of male DNA. Specificity testing was demonstrated by the lack of cross-reactivity with a variety of commonly encountered animal species and bacteria. Also, the multiplex is suitable for mixture study. An average of above 97% of the minor alleles detected with the male/male mixture with 1:3 and 3:1 ratios, while an average of above 70% of the minor alleles detected with the male/male mixture with 1:19 and 19:1 ratios. Full profiles are consistently detected with 125pg of male DNA, even in the presence of excessive amounts of female DNA. In addition, the whole PCR amplification of the 26 Y-STRs can finish in 1h, making the multiplex system suitable for fast-detection.

{"Abstract": ["Soybean is an important oil seed crop, but very few high-density genetic maps have been published for this species. Specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) is a recently developed high-resolution strategy for large scale de novo discovery and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms. SLAF-seq was employed in this study to obtain sufficient markers to construct a high-density genetic map for soybean. In total, 33.10 Gb of data containing 171,001,333 paired-end reads were obtained after preprocessing. The average sequencing depth was 42.29 in the Dongnong594, 56.63 in the Charleston, and 3.92 in each progeny. In total, 164,197 high-quality SLAFs were detected, of which 12,577 SLAFs were polymorphic, and 5,308 of the polymorphic markers met the requirements for use in constructing a genetic map. The final map included 5,308 markers on 20 linkage groups and was 2,655.68 cM in length, with an average distance of 0.5 cM between adjacent markers. To our knowledge, this map has the shortest average distance of adjacent markers for soybean. We report here a high-density genetic map for soybean. The map was constructed using a recombinant inbred line population and the SLAF-seq approach, which allowed the efficient development of a large number of polymorphic markers in a short time. Results of this study will not only provide a platform for gene/quantitative trait loci fine mapping, but will also serve as a reference for molecular breeding of soybean.

{"Abstract": ["To study the relationship between the late postmortem interval (PMI) and trimethylamine-nitrogen (TMA-N) in postmortem tissues of cadaver, TMA-N in muscles, livers and kidneys of rats was measured at different postmortem intervals (PMI) by using a modified spectrophotometric method. The results indicated that the detection sensitivity of TMA-N was 1 mg/L, and there was a good linear correlation between the value of absorbance (A value) and TMA-N at the concentration of 1-10 mg/L (R (2) = 0.9991). Although TMA variation in muscles was different from that in inner organs during the time since death, TMA-N changes in cadaver tissues was positively correlated with PMI. During 2 to 7 d since death, the best correlation between PMI and TMA-N concentration was found in muscles. With PMI as an independent variable, the cubic polynomial regression equation was y= -0.457x(3)+6.519x(2)-24.574x+27.207 (R (2)=0.969). During 3 to 8 days since death, PMI was best correlated with TMA-N concentration in inner organs.

{"Abstract": ["Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a malignancy with low incidence, but with poor prognosis if misdiagnosed. Immunohistochemical assay using TFE3 antibody has been shown to be a sensitive technique for ASPS diagnosis. A specific chromosomal translocation, t(X;17)(p11.2;q25), results in the ASPL-TFE3 fusion gene: it is detectable using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in frozen tumor tissues of ASPS. However, the diagnostic usefulness of these markers has not been investigated in Chinese ASPS patients. Here, we report the first systematic study applying TFE3 immunoassay and ASPL-TFE3 fusion transcript detection to archival paraffin-embedded tissues in a large Chinese ASPS patient population. Sixteen patients had been diagnosed with ASPS (age, 3 to 58 y; 3 male patients and 13 female patients). Their tumors presented predominantly in the extremities (8/16), and were often located in the region of the orbit when affecting infants and children (3/16). Others had tumors in the chest wall, breast, and right pubis, respectively. One patient exhibited a tumor in the renal hilum, a location that had not been previously reported. Two patients had tumor metastases in the lung and the brain. ASPS tumors showed the best immunoreactivity to the TFE3 antibody (16/16). However, their immunoreactivity to other antibodies, including myoglobin (13/16), actin (10/16), desmin (2/16), and vimentin (2/16), was of various degrees. Positive staining was observed for the neural markers, NSE (9/16) and CgA (7/16), respectively. Using a strategy of RT-PCR, followed by a nested PCR with a different primer set, we were able to detect the expression of the chimeric ASPL-TFE3 mRNA in 11 of the 16 ASPS tumors. Of these 11, 7 were type 1 ASPL-TFE3 and 4 were type 2 ASPL-TFE3, including the tumor located in the renal hilum. No expression of ASPL-TFE3 fusion transcripts was detectable in all 38 control tumors. Our results demonstrate that the \"bimarker strategy,\" a combination of TFE3 immunostaining and ASPL-TFE3 chimeric transcript detection, might have sufficient sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing most of the ASPSs.

{"Abstract": ["A fibronectin splicing variant, Fn containing an extra type III domain (EIIIA in rat, ED1 or EDA in human) has recently attracted more attention because of its sensitive response in injury of adult tissue. The characteristic that this form is absent in adult tissue while it is commonly expressed in fetal tissues and injured adult tissue is useful in estimation of injury interval in forensic science. The regulation of fibronectin splicing was studied by immunohistochemistry by using monoclonal antibody to EIIIA on sections from paraffin embedded rat skin sample after contusion. The results indicated that epidermic cells and hair follicle epithelium of rat skin were found positive staining at 6h after injury, and the color became darker with prolonged wounding time. Based on the above result, we invented a type of test paper assayed for EIIIA-Fn splicing variant by using immune colloidal gold technique. After dipping one end of test paper in the supernatant fluid of tissue homogenates of injury skin for few minutes, detecting line could be found. It showed that all experimental injured samples revealed positive staining; the darkness of positive staining was dependent on the injury time, while control normal skin cannot found positive staining.

The enrichment effects of three fiber coatings of SPME for tetramine were compared. Results showed that the enrichment effect of polar 85 microm polyacrylate (PA) coating was better than that of apolar 100 and 7 microm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coatings. Other experimental parameters, such as ionic strength, volume, temperature of sample solution and time for extraction, time and temperature for desorption, were also optimized. The correlation coefficient of the calibration curve was 0.9998 in the range of 0.082-41.0 ng/mL for tetramine. The limit of quantitation of tetramine in urine was 0.082 ng/mL.

{"Abstract": ["The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy in the interpretation of chest nodules using original CT images versus enhanced CT images based on the wavelet transform. The CT images of 118 patients with cancers and 60 with benign nodules were used in this study. All images were enhanced through an algorithm based on the wavelet transform. Two experienced radiologists interpreted all the images in two reading sessions. The reading sessions were separated by a minimum of 1 month in order to minimize the effect of observer's recall. The Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test was used to analyze the interpretation results between original and enhanced images. The Kruskal-Wallis H nonparametric test of K independent samples was used to investigate the related factors which could affect the diagnostic accuracy of observers. The area under the ROC curves for the original and enhanced images was 0.681 and 0.736, respectively. There is significant difference in diagnosing the malignant nodules between the original and enhanced images (z\u2009=\u20097.122, P\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas there is no significant difference in diagnosing the benign nodules (z\u2009=\u20090.894, P\u2009=\u20090.371). The results showed that there is significant difference between original and enhancement images when the size of nodules was larger than 2 cm (Z\u2009=\u2009-2.509, P\u2009=\u20090.012, indicating the size of the nodules is a critical evaluating factor of the diagnostic accuracy of observers).

Specific insect DNA fragments were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction, followed by direct DNA sequencing of the amplification products. Analysis of the cytochrome oxidase II sequences revealed abundant phylogenetically informative nucleotide substitutions that could identify blowfly species to species group. In contrast, because of the low level of sequence divergence of sister species, the data could not distinguish among taxa from the same species group, ie, the species within the Lucilia sericata and Lucilia cuprina groups. The molecular data support the existing species group separation of the taxa within the Calliphora.

{"Abstract": ["Bacterial spot caused by several Xanthomonas sp. is one of the most devastating diseases in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). The genetics of hypersensitive resistance to X. perforans race T3 has been intensively investigated and regulatory genes during the infection of race T3 have been identified through transcriptional profiling. However, no work on isolating regulatory genes for field resistance has been reported. In this study, cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism technique was used to identify differentially expressed transcripts between resistant tomato accession PI 114490 and susceptible variety OH 88119 at 3, 4 and 5 days post-inoculation of the pathogen. Using 256 selective primer combinations, a total of 79 differentially expressed transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) representing 71 genes were obtained. Of which, 60 were up-regulated and 4 were down-regulated in both tomato lines, 4 were uniquely up-regulated and 2 were uniquely down-regulated in PI 114490, and 1 was specifically up-regulated in OH 88119. The expression patterns of 19 representative TDFs were further confirmed by semi-quantitative and/or quantitative real time RT-PCR. These results suggested that the two tomato lines activated partly similar defensive mechanism in response to race T3 infection. The data obtained here will provide some fundamental information for elucidating the molecular mechanism of response to race T3 infection in tomato plants with field resistance.

{"Abstract": ["The case of an unusual DNA analysis of fingernail clippings is described. A 20-year-old woman died of strangulation, and her former boyfriend entered the police's sight as suspect through rapid investigation and inspection. Genomic DNA from debris scraped underneath the suspect's fingernail was extracted 2 days after the incident using the modified DNA pretreatment method. Finally, mixed DNA profiles were observed from the suspect's fingernail clippings, one of them originating from the victim, which is consistent with the result of criminal investigation. With the support of strong evidence, the suspect soon confessed.

{"Abstract": ["The objective of this study was to examine the potential of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) in monitoring yeast communities during wine fermentation and to reveal new information on yeast community of Chinese enology. Firstly, terminal restriction fragment (TRF) lengths database was constructed using 32 pure yeast species. Ten of these species were firstly documented. The species except for Candida vini, Issatchenkia orientalis/Candida krusei, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces pastorianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces kudriarzevii\u00a0and Zygosaccharomyces bisporus could be distinguished by the T-RFLP targeting 5.8S-ITS rDNA. Moreover, the yeast communities in spontaneous fermentation of Chardonnay and Riesling were identified by T-RFLP and traditional methods, including colony morphology on Wallerstein Nutrient (WLN) medium and 5.8S-ITS-RFLP analysis. The result showed that T-RFLP profiles of the yeast community correlated well with that of the results identified by the traditional methods. The TRFs with the highest intensity and present in all the samples corresponded to Saccharomyces sp. Other species detected by both approaches were Hanseniaspora uvarum, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Pichia minuta var. minuta, Saccharomycodes ludwigii/Torulaspora delbrueckii and Candida zemplinina. This study revealed that T-RFLP technique is a rapid and useful tool for monitoring the composition of yeast species during wine fermentation.

The second-division segregation frequency (y) of the AFLP loci ranged from 0.00 to 0.96, with 23.9% of loci showing y-values higher than 0.67, evidencing the existence of interference. The average recombination frequency across the 654 AFLP loci was 0.45, allowing estimation of the fixation index of 0.55, indicating that meiotic gynogenesis could provide an effective means of rapid inbreeding in the Pacific abalone. The AFLP loci have a small proportion (4.4%) of y-values greater than 0.90, suggesting that a relatively low or intermediate degree of chiasma interference occurred in the abalone chromosomes.

{"Abstract": ["To precisely control the application of methyl fluoride (CH3F) for analysis of methanogenic pathways, the influence of 0-10% CH3F on bacterial and archaeal communities in a thermophilic methanogenic sludge was investigated. The results suggested that CH3F acts specifically on acetoclastic methanogenesis. The inhibitory effect stabilized at an initial concentration of 3-5%, with around 90% of the total methanogenic activity being suppressed, and a characteristic of hydrogenotrophic pathway in isotope fractionation was demonstrated under this condition. However, extended exposure (12 days) to high concentrations of CH3F (>3%) altered the bacterial community structure significantly, resulting in increased diversity and decreased evenness, which can be related to acetate oxidation and CH3F degradation. Bacterial clone library analysis showed that syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria Thermacetogenium phaeum were highly enriched under the suppression of 10% CH3F. However, the methanogenic community did not change obviously. Thus, excessive usage of CH3F over the long term can change the composition of the bacterial community. Therefore, data from studies involving the use of CH3F as an acetoclast inhibitor should be interpreted with care. Conversely, CH3F has been suggested as a factor to stimulate the enrichment of syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria.

{"Abstract": ["Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) and human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) are emerging, tick-borne, zoonotic infectious diseases caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia chaffeensis, respectively. Early diagnosis is essential for rapid clinical treatment to avoid misdiagnosis and severe patient outcomes. Simple, sensitive and reliable diagnostic methods are urgently needed. In this study, we developed a duplex real-time PCR assay targeting the A. phagocytophilum ankA gene and the E. chaffeensis TRP120 gene, respectively. The lowest limit of detection of the duplex real-time PCR assay was 100 copies of the targeted A. phagocytophilum ankA gene and the E. chaffeensis TRP120 gene per reaction, and the specificity was 100%. Detection in blood DNA samples from the acute stage of illness for 22 HGA cases and 8 HME cases indicated that the duplex real-time PCR assay was more sensitive than the nested PCR assay. The infection of Citellusundulatus Pallas with A. phagocytophilum and E. chaffeensis was first confirmed in Xinjiang Province and the positive rate was 3.1% for A. phagocytophilum, 6.3% for E. chaffeensis and 3.1% for co-infection with both pathogens. The rates of A. phagocytophilum and E. chaffeensis infection of D. silvarum ticks collected from Shanxi Province were 8.2% and 14.8%, respectively, and the co-infection rate was 3.3%. The rates of A. phagocytophilum and E. chaffeensis infection in H. longicornis ticks collected from Shandong Province were 1.6% and 6.3%, respectively, and the co-infection rate was 1.6%.

{"Abstract": ["Bioaugmentation with degrading bacteria is an effective method to improve the treatment of refractory industrial wastewater; nevertheless there were controversial opinions about the fate of inoculated bacteria and microbial community dynamics. In this study, two lab-scale sequencing batch reactors filled with modified zeolite were used to treat a coking wastewater with pyridine and quinoline shock load, and a bacterial consortium containing three degrading strains was added in one reactor for bioaugmentation. During 120-day operation, the bioaugmented reactor removed over 99 % pyridine, 99 % quinoline, 85 % TOC, 65 % COD, and 95 % NO\u2083\u207b--N with higher resistance to the shock load than the non-bioaugmented reactor. Based on the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S rDNA, bacterial community diversity increased in the bioaugmented reactor. Principal component analysis revealed that, to cope with the shock load, the indigenous bacterial community recovered to the initial structure by acclimatizing itself constantly to the inhospitable environment; but bioaugmentation accelerated the shift of whole bacterial community, resulting in a far different structure from the initial one.

{"Abstract": ["Ganoderma lucidum is a mushroom with traditional medicinal properties that has been widely used in China and other countries in Eastern Asia. Ganoderic acids (GA) produced by G. lucidum exhibit important pharmacological activities. Previous studies have demonstrated that methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is a potent inducer of GA biosynthesis and the expression of genes involved in the GA biosynthesis pathway in G. lucidum. To further explore the mechanism of GA biosynthesis, cDNA-Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) was used to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to MeJA. Using 64 primer combinations, over 3910 transcriptionally derived fragments (TDFs) were obtained. Reliable sequence data were obtained for 390 of 458 selected TDFs. Ninety of these TDFs were annotated with known functions through BLASTX searching the GenBank database, and 12 annotated TDFs were assigned into secondary metabolic pathways by searching the KEGGPATHWAY database. Twenty-five TDFs were selected for qRT-PCR analysis to confirm the expression patterns observed with cDNA-AFLP. The qRT-PCR results were consistent with the altered patterns of gene expression revealed by the cDNA-AFLP technique. Additionally, the transcript levels of 10 genes were measured at the mycelium, primordia, and fruiting body developmental stages of G. lucidum. The greatest expression levels were reached during primordia for all of the genes except cytochrome b2 reached its highest expression level in the mycelium stage.

To better understand chloroplast and mitochondrial inheritance patterns in Actinidia (traditionally called kiwifruit), we performed 11 artificial interspecific crosses and studied the ploidy levels, morphology, and sequence polymorphisms of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of parents and progenies. Sequence analysis showed that the mtDNA haplotypes of F1 hybrids entirely matched those of the female parents, indicating strictly maternal inheritance of Actinidia mtDNA. However, the cpDNA haplotypes of F1 hybrids, which were predominantly derived from the male parent (9 crosses), could also originate from the mother (1 cross) or both parents (1 cross), demonstrating paternal, maternal, and biparental inheritance of Actinidia cpDNA. The inheritance patterns of the cpDNA in Actinidia hybrids differed according to the species and genotypes chosen to be the parents, rather than the ploidy levels of the parent selected.

The subjects were analyzed by a case-control study consisting of three groups--Eales disease group (47 cases), pulmonary tuberculosis group (36 cases) and normal control group (100 cases). The Eales disease group was divided into four parts. Part one consisted of 12 patients who had suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis. Part two consisted of 27 patients who had not suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis. Parts three and four consisted of 27 patients with a positive purified protein derivative test and 12 patients with a negative test, respectively. DNA samples from 47 patients with Eales disease, 36 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and 100 healthy people were detected by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers. The 59 HLA-A/B and HLA-DRB/DQB alleles from Eales disease were compared with those from tuberculosis and normal control, and a correlativity test of common susceptible genes was performed to analyze the potential relationship between Eales disease and pulmonary tuberculosis. The frequency distribution of HLA-A*02 alleles (OR 9.719, OR 95 % CI 4.377-21.580, P = 0.000) and HLA-B*07 (OR 11.605, OR 95 % CI 2.397-56.191, P = 0.001) in the Eales disease group was higher than in the normal control group, but the HLA-A*11 alleles (OR 0.495, OR 95 % CI 0.245-1.000, P = 0.048) were lower than in the normal control group, showing a significant difference. Compared with parts two and four, the frequency distribution of HLA-A*02, HLA-A*11 and HLA-B*07 alleles in parts one and three showed no significant difference (P > 0.05). HLA-A*A02, HLA-A*24, HLA-B*07 and HLA-DRB*16 alleles between the Eales disease, pulmonary tuberculosis and normal control group showed statistical significance (P < 0.05).

The results show that HLA-A*02 and HLA-B*07 may be genetic predisposing genes, but HLA-A*11 alleles may be protective genes of Eales disease, the HLA-A*02 allele may be a common susceptible gene of Eales disease and pulmonary tuberculosis.

This study aimed to identify ileal flora dysbiosis pattern and bacterial species that changed significantly in a rat model of intestinal ischemia and reperfusion and illustrate time courses of both epithelial alterations and gut flora variations in the same injury. Forty-eight rats were randomized into eight groups (n = 6/group). Six groups underwent superior mesenteric artery occlusion for 30 min and were killed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 72 h following reperfusion, respectively; a group of rats were killed just after anesthesia (control), and a sham-operated group received 12-h reperfusion. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of ileal microbiota showed that gut flora pattern changed early after intestinal ischemia and reperfusion, differed significantly at 12 h of reperfusion, and then started to recover toward normal pattern. The specific dysbiosis were characterized by Escherichia coli proliferation and Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacilli reduction. These bacteria that contributed most were identified by principal component analysis and sequencing and confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Result showed the caprine NGF cDNA (GenBank Accession No. JQ308184) contained a 726\u00a0bp open reading frame encoding a protein with 241 amino acid residues. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that caprine NGF amino acid sequence was 83-99\u00a0% identical to that of mouse, pig, dog, human and bovine.

{"Abstract": ["Melon, Cucumis melo L. is an important vegetable crop worldwide. At present, there are phenomena of homonyms and synonyms present in the melon seed markets of China, which could cause variety authenticity issues influencing the process of melon breeding, production, marketing and other aspects. Molecular markers, especially microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are playing increasingly important roles for cultivar identification. The aim of this study was to construct a DNA fingerprinting database of major melon cultivars, which could provide a possibility for the establishment of a technical standard system for purity and authenticity identification of melon seeds. In this study, to develop the core set SSR markers, 470 polymorphic SSRs were selected as the candidate markers from 1219 SSRs using 20 representative melon varieties (lines). Eighteen SSR markers, evenly distributed across the genome and with the highest contents of polymorphism information (PIC) were identified as the core marker set for melon DNA fingerprinting analysis. Fingerprint codes for 471 melon varieties (lines) were established. There were 51 materials which were classified into17 groups based on sharing the same fingerprint code, while field traits survey results showed that these plants in the same group were synonyms because of the same or similar field characters. Furthermore, DNA fingerprinting quick response (QR) codes of 471 melon varieties (lines) were constructed. Due to its fast readability and large storage capacity, QR coding melon DNA fingerprinting is in favor of read convenience and commercial applications."], "Citation": ["PLoS One. 2012;7(12):e52431. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0052431.

{"Abstract": ["The rise of global warming presents a problem for all living organisms, including rice and other staple plants. High temperatures impair rice grain weight by inhibiting the filling of the caryopses during the milky stage. The molecular mechanism behind this process, however, is poorly understood. Identifying candidate genes involved in responses to high-temperature stress may provide a basis for the improvement of heat tolerance in rice. Using paired, genetically similar heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive rice lines as plant materials, cDNA-AFLP analysis revealed a total of 54 transcript derived fragments (TDFs), mainly from the heat-tolerant lines. This clearly indicated variations in gene expression between the two rice lines. BLAST results showed that 28 of the 54 TDFs were homologous sequences. These homologous genes were found to encode proteins involved in signal transduction, oxidation, transcriptional regulation, transport, and metabolism. The functions and differential expression patterns of some important genes are further discussed. High temperature stress may trigger a wide range of changes in gene expression in rice caryopses, in turn affecting functions ranging from signal transduction to cellular metabolism. Forty-five of the 54 TDFs were mapped to rice chromosomes. The genes identified in the present study would make good candidates for further study into the molecular mechanisms underlying rice adaptation to high-temperature stress."], "Citation": ["Plant Sci. 2012 Nov;196:32-43. doi: 10.1016/j.plantsci.2012.07.013.

In the present study, ten primer pairs have been used to clone the DNA sequence and to detect genetic mutations of goat TSHB gene. Two DNA fragments of goat TSHB gene were obtained, which were 2,614 and 1,031\u00a0bp in length, respectively. They comprised about 2.5\u00a0kb 5' regulatory region, all of the three exons and two introns. Goat TSHB gene has a coding region of 417\u00a0bp, encoding 138 amino acids which was predicted to be a secretory protein with a signal peptide of 16 amino acids. The sequence of TSHB gene is highly conserved among mammals. In addition, five mutations (C53A, 3\u00a0bp Indel at the 287-289 locus, 34\u00a0bp Indel at the 584-617 locus, A1819C and E2_72TA) were found in goat TSHB gene and they were shown to be in strong linkage disequilibrium. Interestingly, the genotype distributions for both single locus and haplotype have shown to be significant different between seasonal and nonseasonal goat breeds. And haplotype H2 and diplotype H2/H4 may be related to year-round estrus.

The interaction of OX40-OX40L is involved in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), carotid artery disease and cancer. The genetic variants of OX40L can increase the risk of SLE, atherosclerosis, systemic sclerosis and show gender-specific effects in some studies. Accordingly, we performed a case-control study including 557 breast cancer patients and 580 age- and sex-matched healthy controls to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OX40L gene are associated with sporadic breast cancer susceptibility and progression in Chinese Han women. Seven SNPs of OX40L (rs6661173, rs1234313, rs3850641, rs1234315, rs12039904, rs844648 and rs10912580) were genotyped with the method of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).

We obtained 868 MSAP sites using 18 primer combinations and found (1) a low genomic methylation level (21.3 % on average), but extensive DNA methylation polymorphism (90.2 %) at 5'-CCGG-3' sites; (2) epigenetic variation that is structured into distinct between- (29.8 %) and within- (71.2 %) population components, as does genetic variation; and (3) a significant correlation between epigenetic and genetic variations (P < 0.05).

The majority of these genes encoded products involved in ion transport and compartmentalization, cell division, metabolism, and protein synthesis. The TDFs were clustered into 12 groups on the basis of their expression patterns. Of the 415 reliable TDFs, the sequences of 35 were homologous to genes that play roles in short or long-term resistance to drought stress.

We examined low organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents and enzymatic activity, correlated with fewer bacterial groups and numbers in the glacier forefield soils. The soil pH values decreased, but the soil water content, organic C and total N significantly increased, along the chronosequence. The soil C/N ratio decreased in the early development soils and increased in the late development soils and it did not correlate with the soil age since deglaciation. The activities of soil urease, sucrase, protease, polyphenol oxidase, catalase, and dehydrogenase increased along the chronosequence. The numbers of culturable bacteria in the soils increased as cultured at 25\u00b0C while decreased at 4\u00b0C from younger soils to older soils. Total numbers of culturable bacteria in the soils cultured at 25\u00b0C were significantly positively correlated to the soil total N, organic C, and soil water content, as well as the activities of soil urease, sucrase, dehydrogenase, catalase, and polyphenol oxidase. We have obtained 224 isolates from the glacier forefield soils. The isolates were clustered into 28 groups by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA).

However, the flanking markers from cqSS.A8 showed no significant difference using single-marker analysis, even though the frequency distribution of SS in the BC(3)F(1) was bimodal, suggesting that one novel locus existed. In this study, we characterized the effects of this locus in the NILs and used a published linkage map to determine its location. A three-step approach was designed for mapping the locus in the NILs (BC(3)F(2)): (1) determining the individual BC(3)F(2) genotype at the locus using a progeny test; (2) identifying amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers linked to the locus using a combination of AFLP and bulked segregant analysis; and (3) determining the location and effects of this locus.

Chinensis var. utilis Tsen et Lee) was studied in this work. Samples were taken from two varieties, the early-blooming \"Youqin 49\" and the late-blooming \"Youqingtiancaixin 80\", at five different developmental stages and studied via cDNA-AFLP. Nineteen expression sequence tags (ESTs) associated with bolting or flowering were isolated and cloned. Blast results indicated that 15 ESTs were involved in the synthesis of anthocayanins, photosynthesis, signal transduction, and phytochrome production. Two ESTs had high similarity to hypothetical proteins with unknown function. Two other ESTs shared no similarity to any sequence in the NCBI database and potentially may be newly identified genes. The deduced amino acid sequences of EST amplified by primer A6T4 or A8T4 had high similarity to both dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) and UDP-D: -apiose/UDP-D: -xylose synthase (AXS), thus was named BrcuDFR-like/BrcuAXS. Using the cDNA sequence, a putative BrcuDFR-like/BrcuAXS gene was cloned and characterized from flowering Chinese cabbage via rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA has 1332\u00a0bp with an open frame of 919\u00a0bp which codes for a polypeptide of 313 amino acids. The corresponding genome sequence is 2,046\u00a0bp. Comparison of cDNA and its corresponding genomic sequence indicates that BrcuDFR-like/BrcuAXS contains 9 exons and 8 introns. The temporal expression patterns indicated the gene is more likely to encode the DFR protein, which catalyzes the synthesis of anthocayanins, than UDP-D: -apiose/UDP-D: -xylose synthase (AXS), which catalyzes the conversion of UDP-D: -glucuronate to a mixture of UDP-D: -apiose and UDP-D: -xylose.

To estimate its potential utilization as an inoculant to accelerate straw biodegradation after returning straw to the field, two cellulose-degrading composite microbial systems named ADS3 and WSD5 were inoculated into wheat straw-amended soil in the laboratory. The microbial survival of the inoculant was confirmed by a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, whereas the enhancement of straw degradation in soil was assessed by measuring the mineralization of the soil organic matter and the soil cellulase activity. The results indicated that most of the DGGE bands from ADS3 were detected after inoculation into straw-amended autoclaved soil, yet only certain bands from ADS3 and WSD5 were detected after inoculation into straw-amended non-autoclaved soil during five weeks of incubation; some bands were detected during the first two weeks after inoculation, and then disappeared in later stages. Organic matter mineralization was significantly higher in the soil inoculants ADS3 and WSD5 than in the uninoculated controls during the first week, yet the enhanced degradation did not persist during the subsequent incubation. Similar to the increase in soil organic matter, the cellulase activity also increased during the first week in the ADS3 and WSD5 treatments, yet decreased during the remainder of the incubation period.

{"Abstract": ["Plants of the genus Salvia produce various types of phenolic compounds and tanshinones which are effective for treatment of coronary heart disease. Salvia miltiorrhiza and S. castanea Diels f. tomentosa Stib are two important members of the genus. In this study, metabolic profiles and cDNA-AFLP analysis of four samples were employed to identify novel genes potentially involved in phenolic compounds and tanshinones biosynthesis, including the red roots from the two species and two tanshinone-free roots from S. miltiorrhiza. The results showed that the red roots of S. castanea Diels f. tomentosa Stib produced high contents of rosmarinic acid (21.77 mg/g) and tanshinone IIA (12.60 mg/g), but low content of salvianolic acid B (1.45 mg/g). The red roots of S. miltiorrhiza produced high content of salvianolic acid B (18.69 mg/g), while tanshinones accumulation in this sample was much less than that in S. castanea Diels f. tomentosa Stib. Tanshinones were not detected in the two tanshinone-free samples, which produced high contents of phenolic compounds. A cDNA-AFLP analysis with 128 primer pairs revealed that 2300 transcript derived fragments (TDFs) were differentially expressed among the four samples. About 323 TDFs were sequenced, of which 78 TDFs were annotated with known functions through BLASTX searching the Genbank database and 14 annotated TDFs were assigned into secondary metabolic pathways through searching the KEGGPATHWAY database. The quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that the expression of 9 TDFs was positively correlated with accumulation of phenolic compounds and tanshinones. These TDFs additionally showed coordinated transcriptional response with 6 previously-identified genes involved in biosynthesis of tanshinones and phenolic compounds in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots treated with yeast extract.

{"Abstract": ["Intermittent drainage can substantially reduce methane emission from rice fields, but the microbial mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we determined the rates of methane production and emission, the dynamics of ferric iron and sulfate, and the abundance of methanogen mcrA genes (encoding the alpha subunit of methyl coenzyme M reductase) and their transcripts in response to alternate dry/wet cycles in paddy field soil. We found that intermittent drainage did not affect the growth of rice plants but significantly reduced the rates of both methane production and emission. The dry/wet cycles also resulted in shifts of soil redox conditions, increasing the concentrations of ferric iron and sulfate in the soil. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that both mcrA gene copies and mcrA transcripts significantly decreased after dry/wet alternation compared to continuous flooding. Correlation and regression analyses showed that the abundance of mcrA genes and transcripts positively correlated with methane production potential and soil water content and negatively correlated with the concentrations of ferric iron and sulfate in the soil. However, the transcription of mcrA genes was reduced to a greater extent than the abundance of mcrA genes, resulting in very low mcrA transcript/gene ratios after intermittent drainage. Furthermore, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the composition of methanogenic community remained stable under dry/wet cycles, whereas that of metabolically active methanogens strongly changed.

In the current study, we investigated the inheritance of a yellow-seeded landrace in B. rapa, \"Dahuang\", originating from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Genetic analysis revealed that the phenotype of the yellow-seeded trait in Dahuang is controlled by one recessive gene, termed Brsc1. Mapping of the Brsc1 gene was subsequently conducted in a BC(1) population comprised 456 individuals, derived from (Dahuang\u00a0\u00d7\u00a009A-126)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Dahuang. From a survey of 256 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer combinations, 10 tightly linked AFLP markers were obtained. The closest AFLP markers flanking Brsc1, Y10 and Y06, were 0.2 and 0.4\u00a0cM away, respectively. Subsequently, using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in the reference map, the Brsc1 gene was mapped on A09 in B. rapa. Blast analysis revealed that seven AFLP markers showed sequence homology to A09 of B. rapa, wherein six AFLP markers in our map were in the same order as those in A09 of B. rapa. The two closest markers, Y10 and Y06, delimited the Brsc1 gene within a 2.8\u00a0Mb interval. Furthermore, Y05 and Y06, the two closest AFLP markers on one side linked to Brsc1, were located in scaffold000059 on A09 of B. rapa, whereas the closet AFLP marker on the opposite side of Brsc1, Y10, was located in scaffold000081 on A09 of B. rapa. Molecular markers developed from these studies may facilitate marker-assisted selection (MAS) of yellow-seeded lines in B. rapa and B. napus and expedite the process of map-based cloning of Brsc1."], "Citation": ["Theor Appl Genet. 2012 Mar;124(5):903-9. doi: 10.1007/s00122-011-1754-x.

Reinforcement theory predicts greater prezygotic isolation in areas of prolonged contact between recently diverged species than in areas of recent contact, which implies that old contact zones would be dominated by parental phenotypes with few hybrids (bimodal hybrid zones), whereas recent contact zones would be characterized by hybrid swarms (unimodal hybrid zones). Here, we investigate how the hybrid zones of two closely related Chinese oaks, Quercus mongolica and Q. liaotungensis, are structured geographically using both nuclear and chloroplast markers. We found that populations of Q. liaotungensis located around the Changbai Mountains in Northeast China, an inferred glacial refugium, were introgressed by genes from Q. mongolica, suggesting historical contact between the two species in this region. However, these introgressed populations form sharp bimodal hybrid zones with Q. mongolica. In contrast, populations of Q. liaotungensis located in North China, which show no sign of ancient introgression with Q. mongolica, form unimodal hybrid zones with Q. mongolica.

AFLP based genetic fingerprinting and GC-TOF/MS-based metabolic fingerprinting were used to successfully discriminate the two species. The results of AFLP supported the opinion that Menggu Huangqi was a variant of Mojia Huangqi. The metabolic fingerprinting showed growth locations have greater impacts on the metabolite composition and quantity than the genotypes (cultivated versus wild) in Menggu Huangqi. The difference of some soluble sugars, fatty acids, proline, and polyamine reflected plant adaptation to different growth environments.

However, most previous studies have not defined to what extent the allopolyploidy-induced rapid genomic instability represents a general response, and hence important to evolution, or merely incidental events occurring stochastically in a limited number of individuals. We report here that in a newly formed allohexaploid wheat line between tetraploid wheat Triticum turgidum subsp. durum (genome BBAA) and Aegilops tauschii (genome DD) a great majority of individual plants showed chromosomal stability and exhibited a genomic constitution similar to that of the present-day Triticum aestivum (genome BBAADD). In contrast, a single individual plant was identified at S(2), which exhibited chromosomal instability in both number and structure based on multicolor genomic in situ hybridization (mc-GISH) analysis. Accordingly, this plant also manifested extensive changes at the molecular level including loss and gain of DNA segments and DNA methylation repatterning. Remarkably, the chromosomal and molecular instabilities that presumably occurred at S(0) to S(1) and (or) in the F(1) hybrid were rapidly quenched by S(2) and followed by stable transgenerational inheritance.

An allelic analysis based on a known carrier of the major RSV resistance gene Stvb-i, which is located on chromosome 11, showed that qSTV11-i was not allelic with Stvb-i. A large mapping population was used to delimit the location of qSTV11-i to a 73.6-kb region.

{"Abstract": ["The aim of this study is to characterize extracellular phospholipase, proteinase, and esterase activities of Candida parapsilosis and C. metapsilosis isolated from clinical sources. Using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (SADH) gene fragment, we identified 20 as C. parapsilosis and 11 as C. metapsilosis from 31 isolates of C. parapsilosis species complex. No C. orthopsilosis was identified. A significantly high isolation frequency of C. metapsilosis (35.5%) was observed. Subsequent evaluation of enzymatic profile showed that 90.5% of C. parapsilosis and 91.7% of C. metapsilosis isolates were phospholipase producers. No difference in phospholipase activity was observed between two species. In terms of proteinase, 81.0% of C. parapsilosis and 83.3% of C. metapsilosis isolates were positive. A higher level of proteinase activity was detected in C. parapsilosis. A remarkably high proportion of both C. parapsilosis and C. metapsilosis isolates exhibited strong phospholipase and proteinase activities, suggesting that the production of these two enzymes might be common for them. On the other hand, both species similarly displayed rare esterase activity, with only one C. parapsilosis and two C. metapsilosis isolates being positive. Our data may further add to the confusion concerning the hydrolytic enzymatic activities of the C. parapsilosis complex, and a wider collection of isolates and standardized methods may help to address the issue."], "Citation": ["Mycopathologia. 2011 Dec;172(6):429-38. doi: 10.1007/s11046-011-9440-8.

{"Abstract": ["In poultry as well as in other birds, sexual maturity is one of the important factors influencing female reproduction and egg production. In this study, cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) differential display approach was used to identify genes related to sexual maturity. Using 54 EcoR I/Mse I selective primer combinations, totally 403 differentially expressed transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were isolated, 27 of which belong to 25 unigenes. By real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), the expression pattern of 13 genes was confirmed; among them, four genes including ZNF183 (P < 0.01), KIAA0700, CCT6A, and 23e 15 (P < 0.05) are significantly up-regulated and one gene (Loc418883) is significantly down-regulated (P < 0.01) in sexually mature ovaries compared to immature ones. The mRNA expression dynamics of ZNF183, CCT6A, 23e 15 and Loc418883 were further investigated in ovaries of 70-, 300- and 500-day-old commercial egg-laying hens: the expression level of CCT6A was the highest in 300-day-old hens (P < 0.05), while that of Loc418883 in 500-day-old hens was significantly higher than the other two stages (P < 0.01). The expression levels of ZNF183 and 23e 15 in ovary increase significantly from 70-day-old hens (P < 0.01) and 300-day-old (P < 0.05) to 500-day-old hens, respectively.

In this study, we developed twenty novel sacred lotus SSR markers, and used AFLP and SSR markers to investigate the genetic diversity and genetic relationships among 58 accessions of N.                         nucifera including 15 seed lotus, 12 rhizome lotus, 24 flower lotus and 7 wild lotus. Our results showed that sacred lotus exhibited a low level of genetic diversity, which may attribute to asexual reproduction and long-term artificial selection. A dendrogram based on both AFLP and SSR clustering data showed that: (1) the seed lotus accessions and rhizome lotus accessions were distinctly clustered into different groups, which indicated the significant genetic differentiation between them. This may be attributed to the two modes of reproduction and lack of genetic exchange; (2) the accessions of Thailand wild lotus were separated from other wild lotus accessions. This implied that the Thailand lotus might be genetically differentiated from other wild lotuses. In addition, Mantel test conducted gave highly significant correlation between AFLP-SSR data and each of the AFLP and SSR ones, with the values of r\u00a0=\u00a00.941 and r\u00a0=\u00a00.879, respectively, indicating the higher efficiency of the combination of these techniques (AFLP and SSR) in estimation and validation of the genetic diversity among the accession of sacred lotus.

{"Abstract": ["Genetic profiling of sperm from complex biological mixtures such as sexual assault casework samples requires isolation of a pure sperm population and the ability to analyze low abundant samples. Current standard procedure for sperm isolation includes preferential lysis of epithelial contaminants followed by collection of intact sperm by centrifugation. While effective for samples where sperm are abundant, this method is less effective when samples contain few spermatozoa. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) is a proven method for the isolation of cells biological mixtures, even when found in low abundance. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of LCM coupled with on-chip low volume PCR (LV-PCR) for the isolation and genotyping of low abundance sperm samples. Our results indicate that this method can obtain complete profiles (13-16 loci) from as few as 15 sperm cells with 80% reproducibility, whereas at least 40 sperm cells are required to profile 13-16 loci by standard 'in-tube' PCR. Further, LCM and LV-PCR of a sexual assault casework sample generated a DNA genotype that was consistent with that of the suspect. This method was unable, however, to analyze a casework sample from a gang rape case in which two or more sperm contributors were in a mixed population. The results indicate that LCM and LV-PCR is sensitive and effective for genotyping sperm from sperm/epithelial cell mixtures when epithelial lysis may be insufficient due to low abundance of sperm; LCM and LV-PCR, however, failed in a casework sample when spermatozoa from multiple donors was present, indicating that further study is necessitated."], "Citation": ["PLoS One. 2011;6(8):e22316. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0022316.

{"Abstract": ["Introgression  lines are some of the most important germplasm for breeding applications and  other research conducted on cotton crops. The DNA methylation level among 10  introgression lines of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and three exotic  parental species (G. arboreum, G. thurberi and G. barbadense)  were assessed by methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP)  technology. The methylation level in the introgression lines ranged from 33.3  to 51.5%. However, the lines PD0111 and PD0113 had the lowest methylation level  (34.6 and 33.3%, respectively) due to demethylation of most non-coding  sequences. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was used to evaluate  the genetic polymorphism in the cotton introgression lines.

{"Abstract": ["There is increasing evidence that epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation contribute to phenotypic variation by regulating gene transcription, developmental plasticity, and interactions with the environment. However, relatively little is known about the relationship between the stability and distribution of DNA methylation within chromosomes and the ability to detect trait loci. Plant genomes have a distinct range of target sites and more extensive DNA methylation than animals. We analyzed the stability and distribution of epialleles within the complex genome of the oilseed crop plant Brassica napus. For methylation sensitive AFLP (MSAP) and retrotransposon (RT) epimarkers, we found a high degree of stability, with 90% of mapped markers retaining their allelic pattern in contrasting environments and developmental stages. Moreover, for two distinct parental lines 97% of epialleles were transmitted through five meioses and segregated in a mapping population. For the first time we have established the genetic position for 17 of the 19 centromeres within this amphidiploid species. Epiloci and genetic loci were distributed within distinct clusters, indicating differential detection of recombination events. This enabled us to identify additional significant QTL associated with seven important agronomic traits in the centromeric regions of five linkage groups."], "Citation": ["Genetics. 2011 Nov;189(3):1093-102. doi: 10.1534/genetics.111.131615.

Up to now, there are few reports about co-existence of different porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) strains in China. The aim of this study was to evaluate it in Chinese swine herds. 118 PCV2 positive DNAs isolated from diseased pigs identified by classic PCR were re-detected using a modified differential PCR assay. The results indicated that co-existence rates of PCV2 were 32.2% (38/118) in diseased pigs and 0% (0/41) in asymptomatic pigs. Four PCV2 complete genomes were cloned from two co-infected samples and their nucleotide (nt) identities were 95%-97.3%. The phylogenetic analysis showed that four PCV2 strains were divided into different genotypes, PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2d and PCV2e, respectively. In addition, co-existence were not detected in 41 serum samples from healthy pigs but PCV2 single infection (31.7%, 13/41) existed. These data revealed that the co-existence of different strains of PCV2 might contribute to the development of more severe clinical symptoms for pigs.

This gene has been demonstrated to encode a functional receptor of acylation-stimulating protein (ASP), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), that has been shown to influence insulin secretion in cultured pancreatic islet cells in vitro and is a stimulator of triglyceride synthesis and glucose transport in vivo. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between this novel C5L2 SNP and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the Chinese Han population. A case-control study examining Chinese Han T2DM patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0554) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a0648) was performed to investigate the role of the 698C>T (P233L) C5L2 polymorphism. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis was used to determine expression of this SNP. Heterozygote carriers of the 698CT C5L2 genotype were more frequent among T2DM patients (13.5%) than controls (3.2%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The frequency of 698CT heterozygote carriers was significantly higher in women (12.8%) than in male subjects (5.7%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The odds ratio (OR) of T2DM for 698CT carriers was 4.675 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.840-7.694]. After adjustment of confounding factors such as age, sex, smoking, drinking, hypertension, and triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein levels, the difference remained significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, OR 5.556, 95% CI 2.444-12.630). Furthermore, the diabetic 698CT carriers displayed an increase in their serum TG level. However, there were no significant differences observed in any of the parameters measured in the control group.

{"Abstract": ["The yellow mustard plant in Northern Shaanxi is a precious germplasm, and the yellow seed trait is controlled by a single recessive gene. In this report, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) techniques were used to identify markers linked to the brown seed locus in an F(2) population consisting of 1258 plants. After screening 256 AFLP primer combinations and 456 pairs of SSR primers, we found 14 AFLP and 2 SSR markers that were closely linked to the brown seed locus. Among these markers, the SSR marker CB1022 showed codominant inheritance. By integrating markers previously found to be linked to the brown seed locus into the genetic map of the F(2) population, 23 markers were linked to the brown seed locus. The two closest markers, EA02MC08 and P03MC08, were located on either side of the brown seed locus at a distance of 0.3 and 0.5 cM, respectively. To use the markers for the breeding of yellow-seeded mustard plants, two AFLP markers (EA06MC11 and EA08MC13) were converted into sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, SC1 and SC2, with the latter as the codominant marker. The two SSR markers were subsequently mapped to the A9/N9 linkage group of  Brassica napus  L. by comparing common SSR markers with the published genetic map of B. napus. A BLAST analysis indicated that the sequences of seven markers showed good colinearity with those of Arabidopsis chromosome 3 and that the homolog of the brown seed locus might exist between At3g14120 and At3g29615 on this same chromosome. To develop closer markers, we could make use of the sequence information of this region to design primers for future studies.

In addition, the lowest pH, lower nutrient availability and the most compact soil in pine forest resulted in the lowest microbial taxonomic and metabolic diversities among the five land use patterns studied.", "CONCLUSION: ", "Soil organic carbon, nitrogen and pH appeared to be the most important factors influencing microbial biomass, composition and function in red soil of southwestern China.

{"Abstract": ["Chrysanthemum lavandulifolium (Fisch. ex Trautv.) Makino is a halophyte species that belongs to the Asteraceae family, and the genus Chrysanthemum. It is one of the ancestors of C.\u00d7morifolium Ramatella. Understanding the tolerance mechanism associated with salt stress in C. lavandulifolium could provide important information for explaining the salt tolerance of higher plants and could also help enhancing breeding programs of cultivated Chrysanthemum. In this study, cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) was used to detect differential gene expression in leaves of C. lavandulifolium in response to NaCl treatment. The determination of membrane permeablility, peroxidase activity (POD), malon-dialdehyde (MDA), as well as proline and leaf chlorophyll contents under different NaCl concentrations showed that a 200 mM NaCl treatment was an optimal condition for the cDNA-AFLP experiment. Using this concentration during different times (0, 3 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h), we obtained 1930 cDNA fragments using 64 primers. After sequencing 234 randomly chosen cDNA clones and BLASTx analyzing, we got 129 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) which had no significant homology with other sequences, 85 ESTs were homologous to genes with known functions, whereas the rest of ESTs showed homology to unclassified or putative proteins. 25 ESTs that were similar to known functional genes involved in several abiotic and biotic stresses were confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. The expression patterns of these salt-responsive genes not only responded to salt stress but also to plant hormones, such as abscisic acid (ABA), and to other abiotic stresses such as drought and cold. These results indicate an extensive cross-talk among several stresses.

The results revealed that morphological variations, gradual loss of paclitaxel yield and decreased transcriptional level of paclitaxel biosynthesis key genes occurred during long-term subculture. Genetic and epigenetic variations in these cultures were also studied at different times during culture using amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP), methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. A total of 32 primer combinations were used in AFLP amplification, and none of the AFLP loci were found to be polymorphic, thus no major genetic rearrangements were detected in any of the tested samples. However, results from both MSAP and HPLC indicated that there was a higher level of DNA methylation in the low-paclitaxel yielding cell line after long-term culture. Based on these results, we proposed that accumulation of paclitaxel in Taxus cell cultures might be regulated by DNA methylation.

{"Abstract": ["A new amplification system for ABO and STR genotyping in a single reaction has been successfully developed. Two types of information can be obtained from a biological sample at one time. One is the classical information of ABO blood group typing for screening suspects and the other is STR information for individual identification. The system allows for the simultaneous detection of 15 autosomal STR loci (containing all CODIS STR loci as well as Penta D and Penta E), six ABO genotypes (O/O, B/B, A/A, A/O, A/B, and B/O) and the gender-determining locus Amelogenin. Primers are designed so that the amplicons are distributed ranging from 75bp to 500bp within a four-dye fluorescent design, leaving a fourth dye for the internal size standard. With 30 cycles, the results showed that the optimal amount of DNA template for this multiplex ranges from 250pg to 2ng and the lowest detection threshold is 125pg (as low as 63pg for ABO loci). For the DNA template outside the optimal detection range, we could adjust the number of cycles to obtain the robust profiles.

There were unexpected differences between the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) allelic profiles of the four ribotype 027 genomes, but six bands were identified in all four and a seventh in three genomes. All seven bands and another, not identified in any of the whole genomes, were found in all 21 isolates.

Deviations from individual reference/consensus band sizes were smaller for SCGE (0 to 0.2 bp) than for QCGE (4.2 to 9.5 bp). Compared with QCGE, SCGE more readily distinguished bands of similar length (more discriminatory), detected bands of larger size and lower intensity (more sensitive), and assigned band sizes more accurately and reproducibly, making it more suitable for standardization. Specifically, QCGE failed to identify the largest ISR amplicon. Based on several criteria, we recommend the primer set 16S-USA/23S-USA for use in a proposed standard SCGE method.

{"Abstract": ["Plant variety and cultivar identification is one of the most important aspects in agricultural systems. The large number of varieties or landraces among crop plants has made it difficult to identify and characterize varieties solely on the basis of morphological characters because they are non stable and originate due to environmental and climatic conditions, and therefore phenotypic plasticity is an outcome of adaptation. To mitigate this, scientists have developed and employed molecular markers, statistical tests and software to identify and characterize the required plant cultivars or varieties for cultivation, breeding programs as well as for cultivar-right-protection. The establishment of genome and transcriptome sequencing projects for many crops has led to generation of a huge wealth of sequence information that could find much use in identification of plants and their varieties. We review the current status of plant variety and cultivar identification, where an attempt has been made to describe the different strategies available for plant identification. We have found that despite the availability of methods and suitable markers for a wide range of crops, there is dearth of simple ways of making both morphological descriptors and molecular markers easy, referable and practical to use although there are ongoing attempts at making this possible.

{"Abstract": ["Why some species become successful invaders is an important issue in invasive biology. However, limited genomic resources make it very difficult for identifying candidate genes involved in invasiveness. Mikania micrantha H.B.K. (Asteraceae), one of the world's most invasive weeds, has adapted rapidly in response to novel environments since its introduction to southern China. In its genome, we expect to find outlier loci under selection for local adaptation, critical to dissecting the molecular mechanisms of invasiveness. An explorative amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genome scan was used to detect candidate loci under selection in 28 M. micrantha populations across its entire introduced range in southern China. We also estimated population genetic parameters, bottleneck signatures, and linkage disequilibrium. In binary characters, such as presence or absence of AFLP bands, if all four character combinations are present, it is referred to as a character incompatibility. Since character incompatibility is deemed to be rare in populations with extensive asexual reproduction, a character incompatibility analysis was also performed in order to infer the predominant mating system in the introduced M. micrantha populations. Out of 483 AFLP loci examined using stringent significance criteria, 14 highly credible outlier loci were identified by Dfdist and Bayescan. Moreover, remarkable genetic variation, multiple introductions, substantial bottlenecks and character compatibility were found to occur in M. micrantha. Thus local adaptation at the genome level indeed exists in M. micrantha, and may represent a major evolutionary mechanism of successful invasion.

Our results revealed highly diverse bacterial communities in the Red Sea corals, with more than 600 ribotypes detected and up to 1,000 species estimated from a single coral species.

The associated bacterial communities varied greatly with location, where environmental conditions differed significantly. Corals from disturbed areas appeared to share more similar bacterial communities, but larger variations in community structures were observed between different coral species from pristine waters. Ordination methods identified salinity and depth as the most influential parameters affecting the abundance of Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, Serratia, Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas, and Achromobacter in the corals.

This study aimed to examine the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in UBE2B and infertility in Northeast Chinese men. We carried out a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for SNPs in 312 fertile males and 388 infertile males in Northeast China. Taking advantage of the high degree of linkage disequilibrium among SNPs surrounding UBE2B (r(2) > 0.90), we selected 2 haplotype-tagging SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 5% or greater (rs17167484: g.-293T>G and rs3777373: g.20016A>G) that captured the majority of the genetic variations in a 40-kbp region of this gene. No significant differences between cases and controls were found in the allelic and genotype distribution of the 2 SNPs. However, the haplotype analysis for the 2 SNPs showed that the GA haplotype was significantly associated with a greater than 3-fold decreased risk of male infertility (P = 0.003). Because the frequency of the GA haplotype (1.1%) is relatively low in Chinese men, such a significant finding may occur by chance, but the results are still significant after multiple comparison adjustments (P = 0.012 after Bonferroni's correction).

Physalis philadelphica, known as tomatillo in the Solanaceae, is rich in floral and post-floral organ size diversity. However, its genetic variation is unknown. Here P. philadelphica was classified into three groups with large, intermediate, and small reproductive organ size, and a positive correlation was observed between floral organ and berry sizes. Through cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses, 263 differentially expressed transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were isolated from two accessions with different floral organ sizes. The genes encode various transcription factors, protein kinases, and enzymes, and they displayed multiple expression patterns during floral development, indicating a complexity in the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. Detailed expression analyses revealed that they were differentially expressed during floral and post-floral development, implying that they have roles in the development of flowers and fruits. Expression of three genes was further monitored in 26 accessions, and in particular the expression variation of Pp30, encoding an AP2-like transcription factor, correlates well with the observed phenotypic variations, which strongly supports an essential role for the gene in the natural variation of floral and post-floral organ size in Physalis.

However, the composition of the stones and the mechanism by which the stones are formed in the renal tubules are unknown. We report that cyanuric acid can be produced in the gut by microbial transformation of melamine and serves as an integral component of the kidney stones responsible for melamine-induced renal toxicity in rats. Melamine-induced toxicity in rats was attenuated and melamine excretion increased after antibiotic suppression of gut microbial activity [corrected]. We further demonstrated that melamine is converted to cyanuric acid in vitro by bacteria cultured from normal rat feces; Klebsiella was subsequently identified in fecal samples by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. In culture, Klebsiella terrigena was shown to convert melamine to cyanuric acid directly. Rats colonized by K. terrigena showed exacerbated melamine-induced nephrotoxicity. Cyanuric acid was detected in the kidneys of rats administered melamine alone, and the concentration after Klebsiella colonization was increased.

{"Abstract": ["Abscisic acid (ABA) plays important roles in many aspects of plant growth and development. Botrytis cinerea TB-3-H8, a high-yield strain of ABA, was used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ABA production in the present work. cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) technique was applied to isolate genes differentially expressed between ABA high and low-yield conditions. This resulted in the identification of 856 differentially expressed transcript-derived fragments (TDFs). Forty-five TDFs that displayed obvious up-regulated expression profiles in the ABA high-yield condition were sequenced. Based on BlastX in NCBI, 31 TDFs were assumed to have homology with genes encoding proteins with known functions. According to molecular function of gene ontology (GO) analysis, the 31 TDFs were categorized to proteins with enzyme catalytic activities, transcription factor activities, transporter activities, and kinds of binding activities. Further confirmation of the differential expression of these sequences was carried out by performing semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 10 randomly selected TDFs. Five up-regulated genes were selected to analyze the expression profiles using real-time PCR. This study enriches our knowledge of the molecular basis for ABA biosynthesis in B. cinerea TB-3-H8.

Here, we describe a novel method that couples PCR with restriction endonuclease digestion (designated real-time digestion-PCR, or RTD-PCR) in a one-step reaction tube for detecting somatic mutations from a minority of cells. The PCR mixture contains a thermostable restriction enzyme that digests wild-type alleles during the PCR program, allowing selective amplification of the mutant alleles. To validate this method, we used real-time digestion-PCR for the specific detection of the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) treatment resistance-inducing mutation, T790M, combining with three different platforms: Sanger sequencing, TaqMan probe PCR and Sequenom MassArray.

The availability of the complete genome sequence of S. meliloti CCNWSX0020 provides an opportunity for investigating genes that play significant roles in Cu(II) resistance.

The expression of omp gene strongly increased in the presence of Cu(II). The omp-defective mutants display sensitivities to Cu(II) compared with their wild types. The Cu(II)-sensitive phenotype of the mutant was complemented by a 1.5-kb DNA fragment containing omp gene.

In the giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, a ZW/ZZ sex determination system was previously proposed based on sex ratio data obtained by crosses of sex-reversed females (neomales). To provide molecular evidence for the proposed system, novel sex-linked molecular markers were isolated in this species. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) using 64 primer combinations was employed to screen prawn genomes for DNA markers linked with sex loci. Approximately 8400 legible fragments were produced, 13 of which were uniquely identified in female prawns with no indication of corresponding male-specific markers. These AFLP fragments were reamplified, cloned and sequenced, producing two reliable female-specific sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. Additional individuals from two unrelated geographic populations were used to verify these findings, confirming female-specific amplification of single bands. Detection of internal polymorphic sites was conducted by designing new primer pairs based on these internal fragments. The internal SCAR fragments also displayed specificity in females, indicating high levels of variation between female and male specimens. The distinctive feature of female-linked SCAR markers can be applied for rapid detection of prawn gender. These sex-specific SCAR markers and sex-associated AFLP candidates unique to female specimens support a sex determination system consistent with female heterogamety (ZW) and male homogamety (ZZ).

{"Abstract": ["According to the traditional view, establishment and maintenance of critical population densities in the rhizosphere was the premise of PGPR to exert growth-promoting effects. In light of the facts that soil bacterial community structures can be changed by some PGPR strains including Bacillus pumilus WP8, we hypothesize that regulation of soil bacterial community structure is one of the plant growth-promoting mechanisms of B. pumilus WP8, rather than depending on high-density cells in soil. In this study, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) was performed to evaluate the relationship between changes in soil bacterial community structure and growth-promoting effect on the seedling growth of fava beans (Vicia faba L.) during three successive cultivations. We found that B. pumilus WP8 lacks capacity to reproduce in large enough numbers to survive in bulk soil more than 40 days, yet the bacterial community structures were gradually influenced by inoculation of WP8, especially on dominant populations. Despite WP8 being short-lived, it confers the ability of steadily promoting fava bean seedling growth on soil during the whole growing period for at least 90 days. Pseudomonas chlororaphis RA6, another tested PGPR strain, exists in large numbers for at least 60 days but less than 90 days, whilst giving rise to slight influence on bacterial community structure. In addition, along with the extinction of RA6 cells in bulk soils, the effect of growth promotion disappeared simultaneously. Furthermore, the increment of soil catalase activity from WP8 treatment implied the ability to stimulate soil microbial activity, which may be the reason why the dominant population changed and increased as time passed.

{"Abstract": ["Streptococcus uberis is a common cause of dairy cow mastitis throughout the world. The failure to control bovine mastitis caused by S. uberis is largely attributed to the little known about the epidemiology of this bacteria, especially strain differences in the same area. To define the local epidemiology of S. uberis in the south of Xinjiang, China, we explored the genetic diversity of 28 bovine subclinical mastitis field isolates of S. uberis, collected from 3 Chinese farms during 2009 and 2010, which was examined by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for clustering of the isolates and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to assess the relationship between PFGE patterns and to identify genetic lineages. The 28 isolates were grouped into 13 pulsotypes (U1 to U13), and 1 PFGE type (U1) accounted for almost half of the isolates (13/28, 46.4%). This major type was herd specific, indicating either cow-to-cow transmission or infection with isolates from the same environmental reservoirs. The remaining 12 PFGE types of isolates were from different herds, strongly suggesting environmental sources of S. uberis infection. All 28 isolates were analyzed by MLST and clustered into 8 sequence types (STs), of which 7 STs were found to be novel, either with 5 new alleles of 6 housekeeping and virulence genes (ST158, ST159) or with different combinations of previously assigned alleles (ST153, ST154, ST155, ST156, ST157).

{"Abstract": ["Growth is a priority trait from the point of view of genetic improvement. Molecular markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been regarded as useful for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in complex traits as growth. Using an intermediate F2 cross of slow and fast growth parents, a genetic linkage map of Pacific whiteleg shrimp, Litopenaeusvannamei, based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers was constructed. Meanwhile, QTL analysis was performed for growth-related traits. The linkage map consisted of 451 marker loci (429 AFLPs and 22 SSRs) which formed 49 linkage groups with an average marker space of 7.6 cM; they spanned a total length of 3627.6 cM, covering 79.50% of estimated genome size. 14 QTLs were identified for growth-related traits, including three QTLs for body weight (BW), total length (TL) and partial carapace length (PCL), two QTLs for body length (BL), one QTL for first abdominal segment depth (FASD), third abdominal segment depth (TASD) and first abdominal segment width (FASW), which explained 2.62 to 61.42% of phenotypic variation. Moreover, comparison of linkage maps between L. vannamei and Penaeusjaponicus was applied, providing a new insight into the genetic base of QTL affecting the growth-related traits.

{"Abstract": ["Gene expression profiles of Digitaria sanguinalis infected by Curvularia eragrostidis strain QZ-2000 at two concentrations of conidia and two dew durations were analyzed by cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphisms (cDNA-AFLP). Inoculum strength was more determinant of gene expression than dew duration. A total of 256 primer combinations were used for selective amplification and 1214 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were selected for their differential expression. Of these, 518 up-regulated differentially expressed TDFs were identified. Forty-six differential cDNA fragments were chosen to be cloned and 35 of them were successfully cloned and sequenced, of which 25 were homologous to genes of known function according to the GenBank database. Only 6 genes were up-regulated in Curvularia eragrostidis-inoculated D. sanguinalis, with functions involved in signal transduction, energy metabolism, cell growth and development, stress responses, abscisic acid biosynthesis and response. It appears that a few pathways may be important parts of the pathogenic strategy of C. eragrostidis strain QZ-2000 on D. sanguinalis. Our study provides the fundamentals to further study the pathogenic mechanism, screen for optimal C. eragrostidis strains as potential mycoherbicide and apply this product to control D. sanguinalis.

{"Abstract": ["Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become an important nosocomial pathogen, causing considerable morbidity and mortality. During the last 20 years, a variety of genotyping methods have been introduced for screening the prevalence of MRSA. In this study, we developed and evaluated an improved approach capillary gel electrophoresis based multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat fingerprinting (CGE/MLVF) for rapid MRSA typing. A total of 42 well-characterized strains and 116 non-repetitive clinical MRSA isolates collected from six hospitals in northeast China between 2009 and 2010 were tested. The results obtained by CGE/MLVF against clinical isolates were compared with traditional MLVF, spa typing, Multilocus sequence typing/ staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (MLST/SCCmec) and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The discriminatory power estimated by Simpson's index of diversity was 0.855 (28 types), 0.855 (28 patterns), 0.623 (11 types), 0.517 (8 types) and 0.854 (28 patterns) for CGE/MLVF, traditional MLVF, spa typing, MLST/SCCmec and PFGE, respectively. All methods tested showed a satisfied concordance in clonal complex level calculated by adjusted Rand's coefficient. CGE/MLVF showed better reproducibility and accuracy than traditional MLVF and PFGE methods. In addition, the CGE/MLVF has potential to produce portable results. In conclusion, CGE/MLVF is a rapid and easy to use MRSA typing method with lower cost, good reproducibility and high discriminatory power for monitoring the outbreak and clonal spread of MRSA isolates.

Our result will greatly accelerate the map-based cloning of the BntsMs gene. TE5A is a thermo-sensitive dominant genic male sterility line originating from spontaneous mutation of the inbred line TE5 in Brassica napus and provides a promising system for the development of hybrid cultivars. Genetic analysis has revealed that the BntsMs mutant is controlled by a single, dominant gene. Here, we describe the fine mapping of BntsMs using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and intron polymorphism (IP) methodologies. We screened 1,024 primer combinations and then identified five AFLP markers linked to the BntsMs gene, two of which were successfully converted into sequence-characterised amplified region (SCAR) markers. The linkage of the markers was identified by analysing a large BC2 population of 700 recessive-fertility individuals. Two SCAR markers were found in the flanking region of the BntsMs gene at distance of 3.5 and 4.8 cm. Based on sequence information from the previously screened AFLP markers and on genome organisation comparisons of the A genome of Brassica rapa and Arabidopsis, seven IP markers linked to the BntsMs gene were developed. By analysing the 700 recessive-fertility individuals, two IP markers, IP004 and IP470, were localised to the flanking region of the BntsMs gene at a distance of 0.3 and 0.2 cm, respectively. A comparison of the B. rapa and Arabidopsis genomes revealed 27 genes of B. rapa in the flanking region of these two IP markers.

{"Abstract": ["In an attempt to explore infectious agents associated with nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs), we employed our high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis pipeline, RNA CoMPASS, to investigate the presence of ectopic organisms within a number of NPC cell lines commonly used by NPC and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) researchers. Sequencing data sets from both CNE1 and HONE1 were found to contain reads for human papillomavirus 18 (HPV-18). Subsequent real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis on a panel of NPC cell lines identified HPV-18 in CNE1 and HONE1 as well as three additional NPC cell lines (CNE2, AdAH, and NPC-KT). Further analysis of the chromosomal integration arrangement of HPV-18 in NPCs revealed patterns identical to those observed in HeLa cells. Clustering based on human single nucleotide variation (SNV) analysis of two separate HeLa cell lines and several NPC cell lines demonstrated two distinct clusters with CNE1, as well as HONE1 clustering with the two HeLa cell lines. In addition, duplex-PCR-based genotyping showed that CNE1, CNE2, and HONE1 do not have a HeLa cell-specific L1 retrotransposon insertion, suggesting that these three HPV-18(+) NPC lines are likely products of a somatic hybridization with HeLa cells, which is also consistent with our RNA-seq-based gene level SNV analysis. Taking all of these findings together, we conclude that a widespread HeLa contamination may exist in many NPC cell lines, and authentication of these cell lines is recommended. Finally, we provide a proof of concept for the utility of an RNA-seq-based approach for cell authentication.", "IMPORTANCE: ", "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines are important model systems for analyzing the complex life cycle and pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Using an RNA-seq-based approach, we found HeLa cell contamination in several NPC cell lines that are commonly used in the EBV and related fields. Our data support the notion that contamination resulted from somatic hybridization with HeLa cells, likely occurring at the point of cell line establishment. Given the rarity of NPCs, the long history of NPC cell lines, and the lack of rigorous cell line authentication, it is likely that the actual prevalence and impact of HeLa cell contamination on the EBV field might be greater. We therefore recommend cell line authentication prior to performing experiments using NPC cell lines to avoid inaccurate conclusions.

Total microbial genomic DNA from the small bowel (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), large bowel (proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum), cecum, and feces of normal and rhubarb-exposed rats were used as templates for the ERIC-PCR analysis. We found that the fecal microbial composition did not correspond to the bowel bacteria mix. More bacterial diversity was observed in the ileum of rhubarb-exposed rats (P<0.05). Furthermore, a 380 bp product was found to be increased in rhubarb-exposed rats both in faces and the bowel mucosa.

{"Abstract": ["DNA left on a forensic sample is often prone to degradation, especially if left to the elements. To maximize the chance of retrieving the most information from such compromised DNA, an appropriate profiling scheme using the available technologies needs to be devised. In this study, a total of 62 cigarette ends collected under different conditions of environmental exposure were employed to test the effectiveness of three DNA amplification kits, namely the Applied Biosystems\u2122 AmpF\u2113STR\u00ae Identifiler\u00ae, Identifiler\u00ae Plus and MiniFiler\u2122 PCR Amplification Kits, in the profiling of such compromised DNA. We demonstrated that Identifiler\u00ae Plus could substitute Identifiler\u00ae to improve the effectiveness of profiling for those inhibited cigarette samples. MiniFiler\u2122, on the other hand, could supplement Identifiler\u00ae/Identifiler\u00ae Plus profiles and provide additional genetic information to enhance the evidential value of the samples, especially for those that have suffered from DNA degradation to a greater extent. The findings in this work allowed us to propose a DNA profiling strategy as follow: 1) samples yielding complete Identifiler\u00ae/Identifiler\u00ae Plus profiles require no further testing with MiniFiler\u2122; 2) samples yielding partial single-source profiles to be tested with MiniFiler\u2122 to add genetic information; 3) samples yielding no results are unlikely to yield any results with MiniFiler\u2122.

Immunohistochemical C-erbB-2 and p16 expressions and their associations with clinical and pathological features were analyzed in two tissue microarrays. The membranous and cytoplasmic expression rates of C-erbB-2 were 40.5 and 66.5% in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), and 0 and 9.5% in small cell lung cancers (SCLCs), respectively. The nuclear and cytoplasmic expression rates of p16 were 11.5 and 32.2% in NSCLs, and 45 and 80% in SCLCs, respectively. The cytoplasmic expression of both C-erbB-2 and p16 was more frequent than the membranous expression of C-erbB-2 and the nuclear expression of p16.

Neither C-erbB-2 nor p16 expression was significantly associated with age, tumor grade or stage, presence of lymph node metastasis or survival duration. The abnormal expressions of p16 and C-erbB-2 may play a role in the progression of lung cancers.

{"Abstract": ["The section Moutan of the genus Paeonia consists of eight species that are confined to a small area in China. A wide range of metabolites, including monoterpenoid glucosides, flavonoids, tannins, stilbenes, triterpenoids, steroids, paeonols, and phenols, have been found in the species belonging to section Moutan. However, although previous studies have analyzed the metabolites found in these species, the metabolic similarities that can be used for the chemotaxonomic distinction of section Moutan species are not yet clear. In this study, HPLC-DAD-based metabolic fingerprinting was applied to the classification of eight species: Paeoniasuffruticosa, Paeoniaqiui, Paeoniaostii, Paeoniarockii, Paeoniajishanensis, Paeoniadecomposita, Paeoniadelavayi, and Paeonialudlowii. In total, of the 47 peaks that exhibited an occurrence frequency of 75% in all 23 tree peony samples, 43 of these metabolites were identified according to their retention times and UV absorption spectra, together with combined HPLC-QTOF-MS. These data were compared with reference standard compounds. The 43 isolated compounds included 17 monoterpenoid glucosides, 11 galloyl glucoses, 5 flavonoids, 6 paeonols and 4 phenols. Principal component analysis (PCA), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), showed a clear separation between the species based on metabolomics similarities and four groups were identified. The results exhibited good agreement with the classical classification based on the morphological characteristics and geographical distributions of the subsections Vaginatae F.C. Stern and Delavayanae F.C. Stern with the exception of P. decomposita, which was found to be a transition species between these two subsections. According to their metabolic fingerprinting characteristics, P. ostii and P. suffruticosa can be considered one species, and this result is consistent with the viewpoint of medicinal plant scientists but different from that of classical morphological processing. Significantly large variations were obtained in the metabolic profiles of P. delavayi, whereas no significant difference was found between P. delavayi and P. ludlowii. This indicates that these two species have a close genetic relationship. In conclusion, the combination of HPLC-DAD and multivariate analyses has great potential for guiding future chemotaxonomic studies to examine the potential pharmaceutical value of the effective constituents of tree peony species and appears to be able to clarify the confusion and skepticism associated with the reported morphology- and molecular phylogenetics-based taxonomy of tree peonies.

{"Abstract": ["Mixed semen stains from multiple contributors are challenging samples in sexual assault casework, and it is crucial to obtain the DNA profiles of different donors to allow the evidence to play an important role in investigations and judicial proceedings. Current standard procedures, including preferential lysis, are incapable of separating single-source sperm from multiple male donors. Mixed profiles are often obtained and may not directly exclude or identify suspects. In this case, computational methods for mixture interpretation are often used, which rely on different types of calculation models. Here, we explored a new strategy for sperm cell isolation and detection from mixtures. It is a direct way to obtain genotypes of different sperm donors compared to computation-based mixture interpretation. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) and low volume-PCR (LV-PCR) were used for single sperm isolation and detection. The platform was sensitive; profiling of a single sperm cell generated a minimum of 13-16 loci in 73.1% of Y short tandem repeat (Y-STR) assays. A new Y-STR and autosomal STR multiplex system (YA-STR) were optimized by the combination of the Y-STR locus and 10 autosomal STR (auto STR) loci. The Y-STR locus acted as a tag to discriminate profile groups from different donors. Subsequently, consensus auto STR profiles of various persons could be received. The accuracy and availability of this method were evaluated on a three-donor semen mixture and found to be effective for the resolution of a multi-donor sperm mixture.

{"Abstract": ["Glutaric aciduria type II, or multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, is a rare metabolic disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The condition can be caused by mutations in at least 3 genes, including ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH. When this potentially lethal disorder is known for its clinical and biochemical heterogeneity, mutation analysis will be an invaluable part of diagnosis. We here described a Chinese adolescent boy who enjoyed good health earlier and presented at the age of 14 years with severe vomiting. His condition deteriorated rapidly and he succumbed shortly after. With a travel history before presentation and the late age of onset, diagnosis was particularly difficult. Findings in perimortem biochemical investigations and postmortem autopsy were guiding but not diagnostic. The diagnosis of glutaric aciduria type II was finally confirmed by mutation analysis performed by direct sequencing on genomic DNA from peripheral blood, which identified 2 different unreported missense mutations, c.502G>T (p.V168F) and c.786A>G (p.Q262R), in ETFA. The father and the mother were found to be heterozygous for the 2 mutations in ETFA respectively. Subsequent molecular family screening also ruled out the disease in his elder sister, who had a history of convulsion and a suspicious plasma acylcarnitine profile, and freed her from life-long supplementation. The case showed that molecular autopsies should be part of routine postmortem examination of unexplained sudden death in all age groups and DNA-friendly samples should be routinely collected and archived. In the era of personalized medicine with the power of modern genetics, molecular diagnosis should be obtained for heterogeneous diseases with different genetic defects but sharing similar clinical and/or biochemical phenotypes."], "Citation": ["Diagn Mol Pathol. 2010 Sep;19(3):184-6. doi: 10.1097/PDM.0b013e3181c9a8a8."], "TitleName": ["Role of postmortem genetic testing demonstrated in a case of glutaric aciduria type II."], "AuthorsName": ["Lee HC", "1", "Lai CK", "Siu TS", "Yuen YP", "Chan KY", "Chan AY", "Tam S", "Mak CM", "Lam CW"], "pmid": ["20736750 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "Department of Pathology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong, China."], "email": [], "FullTextLink": ["http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1052-9551&volume=19&issue=3&spage=184"]},

The coronaries were otherwise patent. Gross and microscopic examination of other organs was unremarkable.

{"Abstract": ["DNA methylation is believed to play important roles in regulating gene expression in plant growth and development. Paulownia witches' broom (PaWB) infection has been reported to be related to gene expression changes in paulownia plantlets. To determine whether DNA methylation is associated with gene expression changes in response to phytoplasma, we investigated variations in genomic DNA sequence and methylation in PaWB plantlets treated with methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) techniques, respectively. The results indicated that PaWB seedings recovered a normal morphology after treatment with more than 15 mg\u00b7L(-1) MMS. PaWB infection did not cause changes of the paulownia DNA sequence at the AFLP level; However, DNA methylation levels and patterns were altered. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that three of the methylated genes were up-regulated and three were down-regulated in the MMS-treated PaWB plantlets that had regained healthy morphology. These six genes might be involved in transcriptional regulation, plant defense, signal transduction and energy. The possible roles of these genes in PaWB are discussed.

{"Abstract": ["Biotrophic fungi, such as Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, because they cannot be cultured on nutrient media, to obtain adequate quantity of DNA for molecular genetic analysis, are usually propagated on living hosts, wheat plants in case of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. The propagation process is time-, space- and labor-consuming and has been a bottleneck to molecular genetic analysis of this pathogen. In this study we evaluated multiple displacement amplification (MDA) of pathogen genomic DNA from urediospores as an alternative approach to traditional propagation of urediospores followed by DNA extraction. The quantities of pathogen genomic DNA in the products were further determined via real-time PCR with a pair of primers specific for the \u03b2-tubulin gene of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprints were also compared between the DNA products. The results demonstrated that adequate genomic DNA at fragment size larger than 23\u00a0Kb could be amplified from 20 to 30 urediospores via MDA method. The real-time PCR results suggested that although fresh urediospores collected from diseased leaves were the best, spores picked from diseased leaves stored for a prolonged period could also be used for amplification. AFLP fingerprints exhibited no significant differences between amplified DNA and DNA extracted with CTAB method, suggesting amplified DNA can represent the pathogen's genomic DNA very well. Therefore, MDA could be used to obtain genomic DNA from small precious samples (dozens of spores) for molecular genetic analysis of wheat stripe rust pathogen, and other fungi that are difficult to propagate.

{"Abstract": ["The AnJiBaiCha albino mutant tea cultivar has a reversible albino phenotype at low temperatures. Albino AnJiBaiCha leaves contain high levels of amino acids, which are important components affecting the quality of tea as a beverage. To examine the molecular mechanism of albinism and amino acid enrichment in AnJiBaiCha, we used the amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) technique to isolate genes that are differentially expressed during periodic albinism in AnJiBaiCha. A total of 127 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were successfully sequenced; among those, 60 TDFs showed high similarity to sequences with known functions, but 67 TDFs were not similar to any known genes. The identified transcripts include transcription factors, ubiquitination-related genes, chloroplast biogenesis genes, signal transduction genes, stress-related genes, cell cycle genes, and carbohydrate and energy metabolism genes. To validate the cDNA-AFLP results, quantitative real-time PCR was used to confirm the differential expression of six of the identified genes. The cDNA-AFLP and quantitative real-time PCR results correlated well, indicating that the cDNA-AFLP results are reliable.

Eighty-one individuals of C. nasus were collected from five locations and 12 individuals of Coilia mystus were sampled from the Yangtze River Estuary. A total of 371 loci were detected by five primer combinations, 310 of which were polymorphic (83.56%). Analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) and pairwise fixation index (FST) revealed significant genetic differentiation among five samples, indicating limited gene flow among populations. The dendrogram for populations by neighbor-joining (NJ) cluster analysis provided evidence of a clear relationship between genetic and geographic patterns, supporting significant genetic differentiation between China coastal populations and Ariake Sea populations. Compared to the genetic divergence between C. nasus and C. mystus, the level of genetic differentiation between China and the Ariake Sea populations of C. nasus is obvious below the species level, indicating isolated populations of C. nasus in the Ariake Sea. Isolation by distance analysis revealed that direct ocean distance with deep-water at the continental slope and high salinity between west and east coastal waters of the East China Sea served as major physical barrier to C. nasus, supporting the coastal dispersal pattern in this estuarine species, and rejecting offshore dispersal strategy.

{"Abstract": ["Abnormal substances in the nuclei that can be observed by light microscopy are often broadly referred to as nuclear inclusions. Although their recognition in the appropriate clinicopathological settings can aid in the diagnosis of some disease entities and tumor types, they can also be a source of error. There are 2 morphologically distinct types of inclusions with different mechanisms of formation and diagnostic significance, including bona fide nuclear inclusions and nuclear pseudoinclusions. Bona fide nuclear inclusions result from accumulation in the nuclei of viral particles, cytoplasmic materials (such as surfactant, immunoglobulin, and glycogen), biotin, nuclear lamins, or polyglutamine. Some of them are diagnostically helpful, such as surfactant inclusion, which can support the pulmonary origin of an adenocarcinoma, whereas others may be misleading, such as biotin inclusion, which can be mistaken for herpes infection.

Micromanipulation, which is performed based on differences in cellular morphology, is an effective method for the isolation of cells from mixtures. In this study, mucosal cell was isolated from somatic cellular mixtures (blood and saliva) based on micromanipulation and a low volume-PCR (LV-PCR) platform. One hundred and twenty-six parallel LV-PCR processes were performed using an Identifiler(\u00ae) kit, with 107 reactions yielding single-source DNA profiles. Among them, 54 full profiles (50%) and 37 partial profiles (13-15 loci) were obtained. Based on the above method, we obtained a single-source DNA profile from a cigarette butt contaminated by two victims' blood in a murder case. The generated genotype was used to query a DNA database, and a perfect match was found. "], "Citation": ["J Forensic Sci. 2015 May;60(3):783-6. doi: 10.1111/1556-4029.12715.

{"Abstract": ["In the forensic science community, microRNA (miRNA) profiling has started to be explored as an alternative tool for body fluid identification. Several origins of body fluid can be distinguished by measuring differential expression patterns of particular miRNAs. However, most of reported saliva miRNAs are nonoverlapping and debatable. The aim of this study was to develop a strategy of identifying saliva using miRNA biomarkers for forensic purpose. Eight miRNA candidates were selected to examine expression abundance in forensically relevant body fluids using hydrolysis probes quantitative real-time PCR (TaqMan qPCR). Results revealed that none of them was truly saliva specific, and only miR-200c-3p, miR-203a, and miR-205-5p were higher or more moderate expression in saliva. A stepwise strategy that combines each of three miRNAs with different body fluid-specific miRNAs was developed, and three miRNA combinations could effectively differentiate saliva from other body fluids.

The included 24 STRs belonged to the main international DNA databases (CODIS, ISSL, ESS-extended, UCL, GCL and NCIDD) except D6S1043 (specially chosen for Chinese population). Developmental validation indicated that the STR 25-plex typing system was reproducible, accurate, sensitive and robust. The sensitivity testing of the system was such that a full profile was obtainable even with 125pg of human DNA. Specificity testing was demonstrated by the lack of cross-reactivity with a variety of commonly encountered animal species and microbial pool. For the stability testing, full profiles can been obtained with humic acid concentration\u226460ng/\u03bcL and hematin<500\u03bcM. Also, this multiplex system is suitable for mixture study. All of the minor alleles were called for ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 3:1 of the mixture with the system. In addition, the whole PCR amplification can finish within 1h, making the system suitable for fast-detection. For the forensic evaluation of the multiplex system, 23 autosomal STRs included followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A total of 268 alleles were detected for the 23 autosomal STR loci among 200 individuals. Since 23 autosomal STRs were independent from each other, CMECduo was 0.99999916563607 and CMECtri was 0.99999999986525.

Molecular structure data, such as protein secondary structure and collagen triple helix exhibits, can also be obtained from the same analysis. Thus, several histopathological lesions, for example myocardial infarction, can be identified from FTIR-analyzed tissue images, the latter which can allow for more accurate discrimination between healthy tissues and pathological lesions.

{"Abstract": ["An experimental model of male-mixed DNA (n=297) was constructed according to the mixed DNA construction principle. This comprised the use of the Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 quantitative polymerase chain reaction system, with scientific validation of mixture proportion (Mx; root-mean-square error \u2264 0.02). Statistical analysis was performed on locus separation accuracy using mixsep, a DNA mixture separation R-package, and the analytical performance of mixsep was assessed by examining the data distribution pattern of different mixed gradients, short tandem repeat (STR) loci and mixed DNA types. The results showed that locus separation accuracy had a negative linear correlation with the mixed gradient (R(2)=-0.7121). With increasing mixed gradient imbalance, locus separation accuracy first increased and then decreased, with the highest value detected at a gradient of 1:3 (\u2265 90%). The mixed gradient, which is the theoretical Mx, was one of the primary factors that influenced the success of mixed DNA analysis. Among the 16 STR loci detected by Identifiler\u00ae, the separation accuracy was relatively high (>88%) for loci D5S818, D8S1179 and FGA, whereas the median separation accuracy value was lowest for the D7S820 locus. STR loci with relatively large numbers of allelic drop-out (ADO; >15) were all located in the yellow and red channels, including loci D18S51, D19S433, FGA, TPOX and vWA. These five loci featured low allele peak heights, which was consistent with the low sensitivity of the ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer to yellow and red fluorescence. The locus separation accuracy of the mixsep package was substantially different with and without the inclusion of ADO loci; inclusion of ADO significantly reduced the analytical performance of the mixsep package, which was consistent with the lack of an ADO functional module in this software.

{"Abstract": ["Fusarium wilt of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), caused by Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.:Fr. f.sp. phaseoli (Fop), is one of the most important diseases of common beans worldwide. Few natural sources of resistance to Fop exist and provide only moderate or partial levels of protection. Despite the economic importance of the disease across multiple crops, only a few of Fop induced genes have been analyzed in legumes. Therefore, our goal was to identify transcriptionally regulated genes during an incompatible interaction between common bean and the Fop pathogen using the cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) technique. We generated a total of 8,730 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) with 768 primer pairs based on the comparison of a moderately resistant and a susceptible genotype. In total, 423 TDFs (4.9%) displayed altered expression patterns after inoculation with Fop inoculum. We obtained full amplicon sequences for 122 selected TDFs, of which 98 were identified as annotated known genes in different functional categories based on their putative functions, 10 were predicted but non-annotated genes and 14 were not homologous to any known genes. The 98 TDFs encoding genes of known putative function were classified as related to metabolism (22), signal transduction (21), protein synthesis and processing (20), development and cytoskeletal organization (12), transport of proteins (7), gene expression and RNA metabolism (4), redox reactions (4), defense and stress responses (3), energy metabolism (3), and hormone responses (2). Based on the analyses of homology, 19 TDFs from different functional categories were chosen for expression analysis using quantitative RT-PCR. The genes found to be important here were implicated at various steps of pathogen infection and will allow a better understanding of the mechanisms of defense and resistance to Fop and similar pathogens. The differential response genes discovered here could also be used as molecular markers in association mapping or QTL analysis.

These genes were related to signal transduction, transport, cell wall modification, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, amino acid and protein metabolism, lipid metabolism and stress responses. The ameliorative mechanisms of B on Al-toxicity might be related to: (a) triggering multiple signal transduction pathways; (b) improving the expression levels of genes related to transport; (c) activating genes involved in energy production; and (d) increasing amino acid accumulation and protein degradation.

In this study four genetic maps were constructed for two intergeneric populations. The first population (BC1) was generated from a cross between an Erianthus/Saccharum hybrid YC96-40 and a commercial sugarcane variety CP84-1198. The second population (BC2) was generated from a cross between YCE01-116, a progeny of the BC1 cross and NJ57-416, a commercial sugarcane cultivar. Markers across both populations were generated using 35 AFLP and 23 SSR primer pairs. A total of 756 and 728 polymorphic markers were scored in the BC1 and BC2 populations, respectively. In the BC1 population, a higher proportion of markers was derived from the Erianthus ancestor than those from the Saccharum ancestor Badila. In the BC2 population, both the number and proportion of markers derived from Erianthus were approximately half of those in the BC1 population. Linkage analysis led to the construction of 38, 57, 36 and 47 linkage groups (LGs) for YC96-40, CP84-1198, YCE01-116, and NJ57-416, encompassing 116, 174, 97 and 159 markers (including single dose, double dose and bi-parental markers), respectively. These LGs could be further placed into four, five, five and six homology groups (HGs), respectively, based on information from multi-allelic SSR markers and repulsion phase linkages detected between LGs.

Histological analysis and scanning electron micrographs confirmed the different developmental stages of somatic embryogenesis, including globular-shaped embryo, pear-shaped embryo, scutiform embryo, and mature embryo. cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) was used for comparative transcript profiling between embryogenic and non-embryogenic calli of a new elite maize inbred line Y423 during somatic embryogenesis. Differentially expressed genes were cloned and sequenced. Gene Ontology analysis of 117 candidate genes indicated their involvement in cellular component, biological process and molecular function. Nine of the candidate genes were selected. The changes in their expression levels during embryo induction and regeneration were analyzed in detail using quantitative real-time PCR. Two full-length cDNA sequences, encoding ZmSUF4 (suppressor of fir 4-like protein) and ZmDRP3A (dynamin-related protein), were cloned successfully from intact somatic embryos of the elite inbred maize line Y423. Here, a procedure for maize plant regeneration from somatic embryos is described. Additionally, the possible roles of some of these genes during the somatic embryogenesis has been discussed. This study is a systematic analysis of the cellular and molecular mechanism during the formation of intact somatic embryos in maize.

We also estimated the overall linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci, specific multiallelic or interallelic associations, and haplotype frequencies in males.

{"Abstract": ["The Taiwanese aborigines have been regarded as the source populations for the Austronesian expansion that populated Oceania to the east and Madagascar off Africa to the West. Although a number of genetic studies have been performed on some of these important tribes, the scope of the investigations has been limited, varying in the specific populations examined as well as the maker systems employed. This has made direct comparison among studies difficult. In an attempt to alleviate this lacuna, we investigate, for the first time, the genetic diversity of all nine major Taiwanese aboriginal tribes (Ami, Atayal, Bunun, Rukai, Paiwan, Saisat, Puyuma, Tsou and Yami) utilizing a new generation multiplex Y-STR system that allows for the genotyping of 23 loci from a single amplification reaction. This comprehensive approach examining 293 individuals from all nine main tribes with the same battery of forensic markers provides for the much-needed equivalent data essential for comparative analyses. Our results have uncovered that these nine major aboriginal populations exhibit limited intrapopulation genetic diversity and are highly heterogeneous from each other, possibly the result of endogamy, isolation, drift and/or unique ancestral populations. Specifically, genetic diversity, discrimination capacity, fraction of unique haplotypes and the most frequent haplotypes differ among the nine tribes, with the Tsou possessing the lowest values for the first three of these parameters. The phylogenetic analyses performed indicate that the genetic diversity among all nine tribes is greater than the diversity observed among the worldwide reference populations examined, indicating an extreme case of genetic heterogeneity among these tribes that have lived as close neighbors for thousands of years confined to the limited geographical area of an island.

A significant proportion of the research involving human cell lines was initiated in China. Paradoxically, the cell lines used in China have never been authenticated. Here, we present a comprehensive survey of cross-contamination in 380 samples from 113 independent sources in China using short tandem repeat profiling methods. High levels of cross-contamination were uncovered (95 of 380, 25%). Notable false cell lines (e.g., KB and WISH) are still actively used under their false identity and tissue attributions. Most strikingly, 85.51% of lines established in China were misidentified (59 of 69) and accounted for over half of the misidentifications (59 of 95, 62.11%). Further, 93.22% of the contaminants in cell lines established in laboratories of China were HeLa cells or a possible hybrid of HeLa with an unknown cell line. Results from these misidentified lines have been published in thousands of potentially erroneous articles and may have distorted the findings visible to the scientific community.

Previous studies have shown mRNA biomarkers are effective to identify the origin of biological samples. In this study, we selected 16 tissue specific biomarkers to evaluate their specificities and sensitivities for human body fluids and tissues identification, including porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), hemoglobin beta (HBB) and Glycophorin A (GLY) for circulatory blood, protamine 2 (PRM2) and transglutaminase 4 (TGM4) for semen, mucin 4 (MUC4) and human beta defensin 1(HBD1) for vaginal secretion, matrix metalloproteinases 7 and 11 (MMP7 and MMP11) for menstrual blood, keratin 4(KRT4) for oral mucosa, loricrin (LOR) and cystatin 6 (CST6) for skin, histatin 3(HTN3) for saliva, statherin (STATH) for nasal secretion, dermcidin (DCD) for sweat and uromodulin (UMOD) for urine. The above mentioned ten common forensic body fluids or tissues were used in the evaluation.

This assay was further validated with real casework samples and mock samples (with both single source and mixture) and it was approved that XCYR1 is effective to identify common body fluids or tissues (i.e., circulatory blood, saliva, semen, vaginal secretion, menstrual blood, oral mucosa, nasal secretion, sweat and urine) in forensic casework samples.

{"Abstract": ["Soil contains a large amount of phosphorus, but plants cannot absorb most of this phosphorus effectively. Low inorganic phosphorus has been singled out as a major constraint that leads to a perpetually low Zea mays (maize) grain yield. The fundamental approach to solving this problem is to screen new genes of low phosphorous (LP) tolerance. Consequently, the exploration and utilization of LP-tolerant genes are of great significance in plants. The maize inbred line 178 is an inbred LP-tolerant line. In the current study, the expression of this inbred line was induced under the stress of LP conditions. We applied cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism to screen LP-tolerant genes and obtained and sequenced 78 differentially expressed gene fragments. Their functions were predicted via bioinformatic analysis. There were no function annotations for 8 differentially expressed fragments. Nine genes exhibited high homology to Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa genes involved in phosphorus metabolism. This study lays a good foundation for further cloning and verification of the genes involved in phosphorus metabolism in maize.

{"Abstract": ["Short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping methods are widely used for human identity testing applications, including forensic DNA analysis. Samples of DNA containing the length-variant STR alleles are typically separated and genotyped by comparison to an allelic ladder. Here, we describe a newly devised library of cloned STR alleles. The library covers alleles X and Y for the sex-determining locus Amelogenin and 259 other alleles for 22 autosomal STR loci (TPOX, D3S1358, FGA, D5S818, CSF1PO, D7S820, D8S1179, TH01, vWA, D13S317, D16S539, D18S51, D21S11, D2S1338, D6S1043, D12S391, Penta E, D19S433, D11S4463, D17S974, D3S4529 and D12ATA63). New primers were designed for all these loci to construct recombinant plasmids so that the library retains core repeat elements of STR as well as 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences of \u223c500 base pairs. Since amplicons of commercial STR genotyping kits and systems developed in laboratories are usually distributed from 50 to <500 base pairs, this library could provide universal templates for allelic ladder preparation. We prepared three different sets of allelic ladders for this locus TH01 and an updated version of an allelic ladder for the DNATyper(\u00ae)19 multiplex system using these plasmids to confirm the suitability of the library as a good source for allelic ladder preparation. Importantly, the authenticity of each construct was confirmed by bidirectional nucleotide sequencing and we report the repeat structures of the 259 STR alleles. The sequencing results showed all repeat structures we obtained for TPOX, CSF1PO, D7S820, TH01, D16S539, D18S51 and Penta E were the same as reported. However, we identified 102 unreported repeat structures from the other 15 STR loci, supplementing our current knowledge of repeat structures and leading to further understanding of these widely used loci.

{"Abstract": ["Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a dominantly inherited disorder present from birth that markedly elevates plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and causes premature coronary heart disease. There are at least 20 million people with FH worldwide, but the majority remains undetected and current treatment is often suboptimal.To address this major gap in coronary prevention we present, from an international perspective, consensus-based guidance on the care of FH. The guidance was generated from seminars and workshops held at an international symposium. The recommendations focus on the detection, diagnosis, assessment and management of FH in adults and children, and set guidelines for clinical purposes. They also refer to best practice for cascade screening and risk notifying and testing families for FH, including use of genetic testing. Guidance on treatment is based on risk stratification, management of non-cholesterol risk factors and safe and effective use of LDL lowering therapies. Recommendations are given on lipoprotein apheresis. The use of emerging therapies for FH is also foreshadowed.This international guidance acknowledges evidence gaps, but aims to make the best use of contemporary practice and technology to achieve the best outcomes for the care of FH.

{"Abstract": ["Microdeletions of chromosome 13q31.1 are relatively rare. These types of deletions may cause different genetic effects on genotypes and/or phenotypes. There are several ways to detect microdeletions; noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is the newest detection method. In this study, we aimed to investigate the genetic effects of a 13q31.1 microdeletion detected by NIPT and to reconfirm the feasibility of this procedure in predicting sub-chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs). The 13q31.1 microdeletion, which has previously been described as a disease-associated fragment, was detected by NIPT in a pregnant woman. To validate the finding and to explain the origin of this sub-chromosomal CNV, we collected fetal amniotic fluid and parental blood samples and tested the samples using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Karyotype analysis was performed on all of the samples to rule out balanced or mosaic anomalies. The aCGH results confirmed the NIPT findings. We detected the same type of microdeletion in the fetus and the mother via aCGH. The mother had a normal phenotype; therefore, in a post-test genetic counseling session, we predicted a normal phenotype for the fetus. After delivery, the normal phenotype of the newborn confirmed our prediction. Based on the present study, this 13q31.1 microdeletion may be considered as a chromosomal polymorphism. This study also reconfirmed the feasibility of obtaining a molecular karyotype of a fetus via NIPT.

RB1 has been identified as the only pathological gene responsible for heritable retinoblastoma. Here, we identified 11 RB1 germline mutations in the Han pedigrees of 17 bilateral retinoblastoma patients from China. Four mutations were nonsense mutations, five were splice site mutations, and two resulted in a frame shift due to an insertion or a deletion. Three of the mutations had not been previously reported, and the p.Q344L mutation occurred in two generations of retinoblastoma patients. We investigated phenotypic-genotypic relationships for the novel mutations and showed that these mutations affected the expression, location, and function of the retinoblastoma protein. Abnormal protein localization was observed after transfection of the mutant genes. In addition, changes in the cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rates were observed when the Saos-2 cell line was transfected with plasmids encoding the mutant RB1 genes. Our findings expand the spectrum of known RB1 mutations and will benefit the investigation of RB1 mutation hotspots. Genetic counseling can be offered to families with heritable RB1 mutations.

{"Abstract": ["Postzygotic single-nucleotide mutations (pSNMs) have been studied in cancer and a few other overgrowth human disorders at whole-genome scale and found to play critical roles. However, in clinically unremarkable individuals, pSNMs have never been identified at whole-genome scale largely due to technical difficulties and lack of matched control tissue samples, and thus the genome-wide characteristics of pSNMs remain unknown. We developed a new Bayesian-based mosaic genotyper and a series of effective error filters, using which we were able to identify 17 SNM sites from ~80\u00d7 whole-genome sequencing of peripheral blood DNAs from three clinically unremarkable adults. The pSNMs were thoroughly validated using pyrosequencing, Sanger sequencing of individual cloned fragments, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. The mutant allele fraction ranged from 5%-31%. We found that C\u2192T and C\u2192A were the predominant types of postzygotic mutations, similar to the somatic mutation profile in tumor tissues. Simulation data showed that the overall mutation rate was an order of magnitude lower than that in cancer. We detected varied allele fractions of the pSNMs among multiple samples obtained from the same individuals, including blood, saliva, hair follicle, buccal mucosa, urine, and semen samples, indicating that pSNMs could affect multiple sources of somatic cells as well as germ cells. Two of the adults have children who were diagnosed with Dravet syndrome. We identified two non-synonymous pSNMs in SCN1A, a causal gene for Dravet syndrome, from these two unrelated adults and found that the mutant alleles were transmitted to their children, highlighting the clinical importance of detecting pSNMs in genetic counseling."], "Citation": ["Cell Res. 2014 Nov;24(11):1311-27. doi: 10.1038/cr.2014.131.

{"Abstract": ["Identifying signatures of recent or ongoing selection is of high relevance in livestock population genomics. From a statistical perspective, determining a proper testing procedure and combining various test statistics is challenging. On the basis of extensive simulations in this study, we discuss the statistical properties of eight different established selection signature statistics. In the considered scenario, we show that a reasonable power to detect selection signatures is achieved with high marker density (>1 SNP/kb) as obtained from sequencing, while rather small sample sizes (~15 diploid individuals) appear to be sufficient. Most selection signature statistics such as composite likelihood ratio and cross population extended haplotype homozogysity have the highest power when fixation of the selected allele is reached, while integrated haplotype score has the highest power when selection is ongoing. We suggest a novel strategy, called de-correlated composite of multiple signals (DCMS) to combine different statistics for detecting selection signatures while accounting for the correlation between the different selection signature statistics. When examined with simulated data, DCMS consistently has a higher power than most of the single statistics and shows a reliable positional resolution. We illustrate the new statistic to the established selective sweep around the lactase gene in human HapMap data providing further evidence of the reliability of this new statistic. Then, we apply it to scan selection signatures in two chicken samples with diverse skin color. Our analysis suggests that a set of well-known genes such as BCO2, MC1R, ASIP and TYR were involved in the divergent selection for this trait.

{"Abstract": ["The wide application of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has contributed to the early diagnosis and improved management of prostate cancer (PCa). Accumulating evidence has suggested the involvement of genetic components in regulating serum PSA levels, and several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). However, the GWASs' results have the limited power to identify the causal variants and pathways. After the quality control filters, a total of 330,540 genotyped SNPs from one GWAS with 657 PCa-free Caucasian males were included for the identify candidate causal SNPs and pathways (ICSNPathway) analysis. In addition, the genotype-phenotype association analysis has been conducted with the data from HapMap database. Overall, a total of four SNPs in three genes and six pathways were identified by ICSNPathway analysis, which in total provided three hypothetical mechanisms. First, CYP26B1 rs2241057 polymorphism (nonsynonymous coding) which leads to a Leu-to-Ser amino acid shift at position 264, was implicated in the pathways including meiosis, proximal/distal pattern formation, and M phase of meiotic cell cycle.

{"Abstract": ["DNA-methyltransferase (DNMT)-3A which contains DNMT3A1 and DNMT3A2 isoforms have been suggested to play a crucial role in carcinogenesis and showed aberrant expression in most cancers. Accumulated evidences also indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in DNMT genes were associated with susceptibility to different tumors. We hypothesized that genetic variants in DNMT3A1 promoter region are associated with gastric cancer risk. We selected the tagSNPs from the HapMap database for the Chinese and genotyped in a case-control study to evaluate the association with gastric cancer (GC) in a Chinese population. We identified that the functional tagSNP rs7560488 T>C associated with a significantly increased risk of GC. In vitro functional analysis by luciferase reporter assay and EMSA indicated that the tagSNP rs7560488 T>C substantially altered transcriptional activity of DNMT3A1 gene via influencing the binding of some transcriptional factors, although a definite transcriptional factor remains to be established. Compared with TT homozygotes, subjects who were TC heterozygotes and CC homozygotes exhibited a reduced expression of DNMT3A1. Furthermore, stratified analysis showed that individuals who harbor TC or CC genotypes less than 60 years old were more susceptible to GC. Our results suggest that the genetic variations in the DNMT3A1 promoter contribute to the susceptibility to GC and also provide an insight that tagSNP rs7560488 T>C may be a promising biomarker for predicting GC genetic susceptibility and a valuable information in GC pathogenesis.

{"Abstract": ["It was the aim of this work to assess and track the workload, working conditions and professional recognition of radiation oncology medical physicists (ROMPs) in the Asia Pacific region over time. In this third survey since 2008, a structured questionnaire was mailed in 2014 to 22 senior medical physicists representing 23 countries. As in previous surveys the questionnaire covered seven themes: 1 education, training and professional certification, 2 staffing, 3 typical tasks, 4 professional organisations, 5 resources, 6 research and teaching, and 7 job satisfaction. The response rate of 100% is a result of performing a survey through a network, which allows easy follow-up. The replies cover 4841 ROMPs in 23 countries. Compared to 2008, the number of medical physicists in many countries has doubled. However, the number of experienced ROMPs compared to the overall workforce is still small, especially in low and middle income countries. The increase in staff is matched by a similar increase in the number of treatment units over the years. Furthermore, the number of countries using complex techniques (IMRT, IGRT) or installing high end equipment (tomotherapy, robotic linear accelerators) is increasing. Overall, ROMPs still feel generally overworked and the professional recognition, while varying widely, appears to be improving only slightly.

Using large-scale label-free proteome quantitation, we also found some 8p deficiencies, such as the presence of 8p21-p23 in tumorigenesis of the above-described digestive organs, which is in good agreement with previous reports. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to have verified these 8p deficiencies at the proteome level, complementing genome and transcriptome data."], "Citation": ["J Proteome Res. 2013 Jan 4;12(1):81-8. doi: 10.1021/pr300834r.

{"Abstract": ["The launch of the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project provides an opportunity to gain insight into the human proteome. The Chinese Human Chromosome Proteome Consortium has initiated proteomic exploration of protein-encoding genes on human chromosomes 1, 8, and 20. Collaboration within the consortium has generated a comprehensive proteome data set using normal and carcinomatous tissues from human liver, stomach, and colon and 13 cell lines originating in these organs. We identified 12,101 proteins (59.8% coverage against Swiss-Prot human entries) with a protein false discovery rate of less than 1%. On chromosome 1, 1,252 proteins mapping to 1,227 genes, representing 60.9% of Swiss-Prot entries, were identified; however, 805 proteins remain unidentified, suggesting that analysis of more diverse samples using more advanced proteomic technologies is required. Genes encoding the unidentified proteins were concentrated in seven blocks, located at p36, q12-21, and q42-44, partly consistent with correlation of these blocks with cancers of the liver, stomach, and colon. Combined transcriptome, proteome, and cofunctionality analyses confirmed 23 coexpression clusters containing 165 genes. Biological information, including chromosome structure, GC content, and protein coexpression pattern was analyzed using multilayered, circular visualization and tabular visualization.

{"Abstract": ["The haplotype assembly problem has been proven to be complex. Heuristic algorithms are the main methods that are used to solve the problem. These algorithms perform well when the SNP fragments are error-free, but they are less accurate when the error rate increases. The complex relationships caused by fragment errors present a major barrier to assembling accurate haplotypes. Therefore, modeling the complex relationships is the key to solve the problem. In this study, we model the haplotype assembly problem using hypergraph partitioning formulations and propose a novel method termed HGHap (Hypergraph-based Haplotype assembly method). HGHap approaches the haplotype assembly problem in two phases. In the first phase, a hypergraph is constructed in which each vertex corresponds to a fragment and vertices are multiply connected to form hyperedges. In the second phase, a hypergraph partitioning algorithm is employed to obtain two groups of fragments to construct the haplotypes. The hyperedges capture higher-order relationships among fragments that facilitate the subsequent partitioning. Our results demonstrate that the method performs better than other methods in most cases, especially in cases with a high error rate.

{"Abstract": ["Gliomas are a common adult central nervous system tumor, and glioblastoma (GBM), which has a poor prognosis, is the most lethal of all gliomas. The overall survival of GBM patients is only 12-14 months after diagnosis. With progress in the precision of personal medication, therapeutic options for various tumors have become gradually dependent on the molecular profiles of patients. GBM is one of the tumors in which treatment response relies largely on the molecular characteristics of the tumor. Therefore, awareness of the genetic background of each patient will help decision-making regarding the best treatment strategy to use. In this review, a novel molecular classification of gliomas based on recent findings of their genetic characteristics is introduced. Representative molecular markers, such as IDH1 mutation, 1p19q co-deletion, MGMT promoter methylation and EGFRvIII amplification, are described. Furthermore, the development of non-coding RNAs and omics studies of GBM are briefly discussed. Finally, a novel concept for non-invasive detection that could facilitate both diagnosis and treatment monitoring is presented. There is no doubt that the use of molecular profiling by biomarkers will indeed improve the overall survival and quality of life of GBM patients.

{"Abstract": ["Antibiotics resistance in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the major factor for eradication failure. Molecular tests including fluorescence in situ hybridization, PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, and dual priming oligonucleotide-PCR (DPO-PCR) play critical roles in the detection of antibiotic susceptibility; however, limited knowledge is known about application of multiple genetic analysis system (MGAS) in the area of H. pylori identification and antibiotics resistance detection.The aim of this study is to determine the antibiotics resistance using different molecular tests and evaluate the treatment outcomes of E-test-based genotypic resistance.A total of 297 patients with dyspepsia complaint were recruited for gastroscopies. Ninety patients with H. pylori culture positive were randomly divided into 2 groups (test group and control group). E-test, general PCR, and MGAS assay were performed in test group. Patients in control group were treated with empirical therapy (rabeprazole + bismuth potassium citrate + amoxicillin [AMX] + clarithromycin [CLR]), whereas patients in test group received quadruple therapy based on E-test results twice daily for 14 consecutive days. The eradication effect of H. pylori was confirmed by C-urea breath test after at least 4 weeks when treatment was finished.Rapid urease test showed 46.5% (128/297) patients with H. pylori infection, whereas 30.3% (90/297) patients were H. pylori culture positive. E-test showed that H. pylori primary resistance rate to CLR, AMX, metronidazole, tetracycline, and levofloxacin (LVX) was 40.0% (18/45), 4.4% (2/45), 53.3% (24/45), 0% (0/45), and 55.6% (25/45), respectively. In addition, there are many multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotypes, and the MDR strains have higher minimum inhibitory concentration than their single-drug resistant counterparts. Considering E-test as the reference test, the sensitivities of general PCR and MGAS in detecting CLR resistance were 83.3% (15/18) and 94.4% (17/18), whereas in detecting LVX resistance were 100% (25/25) and 83.3% (15/18), respectively. Finally, the eradication rate in test group was significantly higher than that in control group as demonstrated by intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis.MGAS is a promising assay for H. pylori identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing.

Traditional morphopathology primarily emphasizes qualitative diagnosis of PLC, which is not sufficient to resolve the major concern of increasing the long-term treatment efficacy of PLC in clinical management for the modern era. Since the beginning of the 21st century, molecular pathology has played an active role in the investigation of the evaluation of the metastatic potential of PLC, detection of drug targets, prediction of recurrence risks, analysis of clonal origins, evaluation of the malignancy trend of precancerous lesions, and determination of clinical prognosis. As a result, many new progresses have been obtained, and new strategies of molecular-pathological diagnosis have been formed. Moreover, the new types of pathobiological diagnosis indicator systems for PLC have been preliminarily established. These achievements provide valuable molecular pathology-based guide for clinical formulation of individualized therapy programs for PLC.

{"Abstract": ["Fluorescent organic dots are emerging as promising bioimaging reagents because of their high brightness, good photostability, excellent biocompatibility, and facile surface functionalization. Organic dots with large two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections are highly desired for two-photon fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we report two biocompatible and photostable organic dots fabricated by encapsulating tetraphenylethene derivatives within DSPE-PEG matrix. The two organic dots show absorption maxima at 425 and 483 nm and emit green and red fluorescence at 560 and 645 nm, with high fluorescence quantum yields of 64% and 22%, respectively. Both organic dots exhibit excellent TPA property in the range of 800-960 nm, affording upon excitation at 820 nm remarkably large TPA cross sections of 1.2\u00d710(6) and 2.5\u00d710(6) GM on the basis of dot concentration. The bare fluorophores and their organic dots are biocompatible and have been used to stain living cells for one- and two-photon fluorescence bioimagings. The cRGD-modified organic dots can selectively target integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 overexpressing breast cancer cells for targeted imaging. The organic dots are also applied for real-time two-photon fluorescence in vivo visualization of the blood vasculature of mouse ear, providing the spatiotemporal information about the whole blood vascular network.

{"Abstract": ["Patients with microinvasive carcinoma often have favorable prognosis, but it remains unclear whether this special type of breast cancer represents a distinct morphological entity with its own biological features and clinical behavior distinct from those of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The study is a retrospective analysis of a large patient cohort from a single institution. One hundred and thirty one microinvasive carcinoma and 451 DCIS cases were collected. ER, PR, HER2, and Ki67 were examined by immunohistochemistry in pathological sections. We assessed the clinicopathologic characteristics, molecular features, and survival status of microinvasive carcinoma and compared to those of DCIS. Microinvasive carcinoma differed from DCIS with respect to tumor size, lymph node status, and initial presentation (P\u2009<\u20090.05). There was a significant difference in nuclear grade among microinvasive carcinoma of different molecular subtype (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The clinicalpathologic features and outcomes of patients with microinvasive carcinoma were similar to those with DCIS. The 5-year OS rate for microinvasive carcinoma and DCIS patients was 99.0 and 99.2%, respectively. A combination of pathologic, clinical, and molecular factors may ultimately reveal more powerful and robust measures for disease classification than any one modality alone.

In this study, axonal injury in the brainstem of rats with traumatic brain injury at 72 h post-trauma, which was confirmed with beta-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP) immunostaining, was detected with FTIRM technique. The lower intensity of infrared absorbance under the amide I band corresponds strongly to the area of axonal injury, and further analysis of amide I band shows significant differences in protein conformation between injured and normal axons.

{"Abstract": ["Genotype imputation is now routinely applied in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses. However, most of the imputations have been run using HapMap samples as reference, imputation of low frequency and rare variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%) are not systemically assessed. With the emergence of next-generation sequencing, large reference panels (such as the 1000 Genomes panel) are available to facilitate imputation of these variants. Therefore, in order to estimate the performance of low frequency and rare variants imputation, we imputed 153 individuals, each of whom had 3 different genotype array data including 317k, 610k and 1 million SNPs, to three different reference panels: the 1000 Genomes pilot March 2010 release (1KGpilot), the 1000 Genomes interim August 2010 release (1KGinterim), and the 1000 Genomes phase1 November 2010 and May 2011 release (1KGphase1) by using IMPUTE version 2. The differences between these three releases of the 1000 Genomes data are the sample size, ancestry diversity, number of variants and their frequency spectrum. We found that both reference panel and GWAS chip density affect the imputation of low frequency and rare variants. 1KGphase1 outperformed the other 2 panels, at higher concordance rate, higher proportion of well-imputed variants (info>0.4) and higher mean info score in each MAF bin. Similarly, 1M chip array outperformed 610K and 317K. However for very rare variants (MAF \u2264 0.3%), only 0-1% of the variants were well imputed. We conclude that the imputation of low frequency and rare variants improves with larger reference panels and higher density of genome-wide genotyping arrays. Yet, despite a large reference panel size and dense genotyping density, very rare variants remain difficult to impute."], "Citation": ["PLoS One. 2015 Jan 26;10(1):e0116487. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0116487. eCollection 2015."], "TitleName": ["Performance of genotype imputation for low frequency and rare variants from the 1000 genomes."], "AuthorsName": ["Zheng HF", "1", "Rong JJ", "2", "Liu M", "2", "Han F", "3", "Zhang XW", "2", "Richards JB", "4", "Wang L", "2"], "pmid": ["25621886 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]", "PMC4306552"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "Institute of Aging Research, School of Medicine, Hangzhou Normal University, and the Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China; Department of Medicine, Human Genetics, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.", "2", "Institute of Aging Research, School of Medicine, Hangzhou Normal University, and the Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.", "3", "Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care Medicine, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China.", "4", "Department of Medicine, Human Genetics, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."], "email": ["h-zheng@live.com", "d:otliam"], "FullTextLink": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/25621886/", "http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116487"]},

However, to the authors' knowledge, CO poisoning deaths in the mainland China are scarcely studied. Therefore, this study aims to explore the incidence trend of CO poisoning deaths that occurred in Wuhan - a mega city in Central China - for a six-year period (2009-2014). This arguably is the first comprehensive study to provide an overall analysis of CO poisoning deaths that sampled the mainland Chinese population. Using the data provided by the legal physicians who are employed in nine districts of Wuhan, a total of 131 cases of CO poisoning that resulted in the death of 156 victims are collected. Out of the total, 76 cases (97 deaths) are classified as accidents, 49 cases (51 deaths) are suicides, three cases (four deaths) are homicides, one case (three deaths) is homicide-suicide, and one case (one death) is classified as undetermined. Male victims are found to be the dominant sex group (53.5%; N=83); with a mean age of 44.9 years, while female victims averagely aged 46.1 years. The highest death occurring month is in January, and followed by February and December.

{"Abstract": ["Genome-wide scans for signals of natural selection in human populations have identified a large number of candidate loci that underlie local adaptations. This is surprising given the relatively short evolutionary time since the divergence of the human population. One hypothesis that has not been formally examined is whether and how the recent human evolution may have been shaped by coselection in the context of complex molecular interactome. In this study, genome-wide signals of selection were scanned in East Asians, Europeans, and Africans using 1000 Genome data, and subsequently mapped onto the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. We found that the candidate genes of recent positive selection localized significantly closer to each other on the PPI network than expected, revealing substantial clustering of selected genes. Furthermore, gene pairs of shorter PPI network distances showed higher similarities of their recent evolutionary paths than those further apart. Last, subnetworks enriched with recent coselection signals were identified, which are substantially overrepresented in biological pathways related to signal transduction, neurogenesis, and immune function. These results provide the first genome-wide evidence for association of recent selection signals with the PPI network, shedding light on the potential mechanisms of recent coselection in the human genome.

{"Abstract": ["Stripe rust-resistant wheat introgression line CH223 was developed by crossing the resistant partial amphiploid TAI7047 derived from Thinopyrum intermedium with susceptible cultivars. The resistance is effective against all the existing Chinese stripe rust races, including the most widely virulent and predominant pathotypes CYR32 and CYR33. Cytological analyses using GISH detected no chromosomal segments from Th. intermedium. It was presumed that the segment was too small to be detected. Normal bivalent pairing at meiosis in CH223 and its hybrids confirmed its stability. Genetic analysis of the F(1), F(2), F(3) and BC(1) populations from crosses of CH223 with susceptible lines indicated that resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene. The resistance gene was mapped using an F(2:3) population from Taichung 29/CH223. The gene was linked to five co-dominant genomic SSR markers, Xgwm540, Xbarc1096, Xwmc47, Xwmc310 and Xgpw7272, and flanked by Xbarc1096 and Xwmc47 at 8.0 and 7.2 cM, respectively.

We wondered whether the currently recognized predictors could be used to categorize acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who underwent transplantation during remission into risk groups. We analyzed the data of 255 consecutive patients (median age, 26) with AML in their first or second remission (CR1 or CR2) after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Three parameters were found to be predictive of outcome: response after induction therapy, white blood cell count at diagnosis, and cytogenetics. These three factors were combined to yield two risk groups. The 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse for patients at low and high risk were 8% and 36% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), respectively. The 3-year probabilities of leukemia-free survival for these two groups were 80% and 52% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), respectively.

{"Abstract": ["Molecular organization of a cell is dynamically transformed along the course of cellular physiological processes, pathologic developments or derived from interactions with drugs. The capability to measure and monitor concentrations of macromolecules in a single cell would greatly enhance studies of cellular processes in heterogeneous populations. In this communication, we introduce and experimentally validate a bio-analytical single-cell assay, wherein the overall concentration of macromolecules is estimated in specific subcellular domains, such as structure-function compartments of the cell nucleus as well as in nucleoplasm. We describe quantitative mapping of local biomolecular concentrations, either intrinsic relating to the functional and physiological state of a cell, or altered by a therapeutic drug action, using two-photon excited fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). The proposed assay utilizes a correlation between the fluorescence lifetime of fluorophore and the refractive index of its microenvironment varying due to changes in the concentrations of macromolecules, mainly proteins. Two-photon excitation in Near-Infra Red biological transparency window reduced the photo-toxicity in live cells, as compared with a conventional single-photon approach. Using this new assay, we estimated average concentrations of proteins in the compartments of nuclear speckles and in the nucleoplasm at ~150 mg/ml, and in the nucleolus at ~284 mg/ml. Furthermore, we show a profound influence of pharmaceutical inhibitors of RNA synthesis on intracellular protein density. The approach proposed here will significantly advance theranostics, and studies of drug-cell interactions at the single-cell level, aiding development of personal molecular medicine.

We found that Aurora-A and BRCA2 inversely controlled RAS-associated genomic instability and ovarian tumorigenesis through regulation of cytokinesis and polyploidization. Overexpression of mutated RAS ablated BRCA2 expression but induced Aurora-A accumulation at the midbody, leading to abnormal cytokinesis and ultimately chromosomal instability via polyploidy in cancer cells.

However, due to extensive growing of cultivars with disease resistance genes from short arm of rye chromosome 1R and coevolution of pathogen virulence and host resistance, these cultivars successively lost resistance to pathogens. Identification and deployment of new resistance gene sources in rye are, therefore, of especial importance and urgency. A new wheat-rye line, designated as WR41-1, was produced through distant hybridization and chromosome engineering protocols between common wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 and rye cultivar German White. It was proved to be a new wheat-rye T4BL\u00b74RL and T7AS\u00b74RS translocation line using sequential genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mc-FISH), and expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) marker analysis. WR41-1 showed high levels of resistance to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt) pathogens prevalent in China at the adult growth stage and 13 of 23 Bgt isolates tested at the seedling stage.

Integration of genetic loci into physical localizations showed considerable variation of genome organization, structure, and size between 12A and 12D homoeologous chromosomes. The distal regions of the chromosomes displayed relatively lower levels of structural and size variation than other regions of the chromosomes. The highest level of variation was found in the pericentric regions in the long arms of the two homoeologous chromosomes. The genome-size difference between A and D sub-genomes in allotetraploid cotton was mainly associated with uneven expansion or contraction between different regions of homoeologous chromosomes.

Concentrations of 50\u00a0\u03bcmol/L Cd mainly induced C-mitosis, while more than 100\u00a0\u03bcmol/L Cd mainly caused chromosome breakage and chromosome adhesion in hairy root tip cells.

{"Abstract": ["Previous studies concerning BCR-ABL mRNA levels by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Q-PCR) for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) have shown a significant concordance between peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) assays. The objective of this study was to determine whether molecular monitoring using PB was comparable to using BM for CML. A comparative study was performed that analyzed the Q-PCR results of 712 simultaneous PB and BM samples from 330 patients before and during imatinib therapy. For the 78 paired pretreatment samples, the level of BCR-ABL mRNA in PB was lower than that in BM (P = 0.007). Although the overall amounts of BCR-ABL mRNA in the PB and BM were comparable (P= 0.072) and there was a strong correlation (r = 0.839, P < 0.001) with the 634 paired on-treatment samples, the depth of the molecular response in PB was lower than that in BM (P < 0.001). The level of BCR-ABL mRNA in PB was lower than that in BM where the BM BCR-ABL mRNA < 1 log reduction (P < 0.001) or \u2265 1-< 2 log-reductions (P = 0.008) from the baseline, and higher than that where the BM BCR-ABL mRNA \u2265 2 log-reductions (P < 0.001).

{"Abstract": ["Two protocols of plant regeneration for cotton were adopted in this study, namely, 2, 4-D and kinetin hormone combination and IBA and kinetin hormone combination. Twenty-eight embryogenic cell lines via somatic embryogenesis and 67 regenerated plants from these embryogenic calli were selected and used for random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), simple sequence repeat (SSR), chromosomal number counting, and flow cytometric analysis. The roles of RAPD and SSR markers in detecting somaclonal variation of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) were evaluated. Two cluster analyses were performed to express, in the form of dendrograms, the relationships among the hormone combinations and the genetic variability. Both DNA-based techniques were able to amplify all of the cell clones and regenerated plantlets genomes and relative higher genetic variation could be detected in the culture type with 2, 4-D and kinetin hormone combination. The result suggested that 2, 4-D and kinetin hormone combination could induce relative high somaclonal variation and RAPD and SSR markers are useful in detecting somaclonal variation of regenerated cotton plants via somatic embryogenesis. Chromosome number counting and flow cytometry analysis revealed that the number of chromosomes and ploidy levels were nearly stable in all regenerated plants except two regenerated plantlets (lost 4 and 5 chromosomes, respectively) which meant that cytological changes were not correlated with the frequency of RAPD and SSR polymorphisms.

In this procedure, most of the resulting cells' mitochondrial DNA, if not all, is also from the PS's cells. The procedure involves several rounds of the following three steps, starting from an allogeneic human ES cell line: the creation of tetraploid ES cells by fusion of somatic cells from the prospective PS with the ES cells, the differentiation of these cells into tetraploid oogonia that give rise to diploid oocytes following meiosis, and the isolation of ES cells from parthenogenetic blastocysts, morula, 8-cell embryos, or 4-cell embryos derived from these oocytes. After sufficient repetition of this process using the prospective PS's somatic cells, the genetic contribution of the original allogeneic ES cells will be low enough not to trigger an immune response.

The results have been integrated into published comparative maps, providing an opportunity to assess genome-wide chromosomal homologies between the representatives of eight bat families. Our results further substantiate the wide occurrence of Robertsonian translocations in bats, with the possible involvement of whole-arm reciprocal translocations (WARTs). In order to search for valid cytogenetic signature(s) for each family and superfamily, evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements identified by chromosomal painting and/or banding comparison are subjected to two independent analyses: (1) a cladistic analysis using parsimony and (2) the mapping of these chromosomal changes onto the molecularly defined phylogenetic tree available from the literature.

{"Abstract": ["Sexual progenies of asymmetric somatic hybrids between Brassica napus and Crambe abyssinica were analyzed with respect to chromosomal behavior, fae1 gene introgression, fertility, and fatty-acid composition of the seed. Among 24 progeny plants investigated, 11 plants had 38 chromosomes and were characterized by the occurrence of normal meiosis with 19 bivalents. The other 13 plants had more than 38 chromosomes, constituting a complete chromosomal set from B. napus plus different numbers of additional chromosomes from C. abyssinica. The chromosomes of B. napus and C. abyssinica origin could be clearly discriminated by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) in mitotic and meiotic cells. Furthermore, meiotic GISH enabled identification of intergenomic chromatin bridges and of asynchrony between the B. napus and C. abyssinca meiotic cycles. Lagging, bridging and late disjunction of univalents derived from C. abyssinica were observed. Analysis of cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers derived from the fae1 gene showed novel patterns different from the B. napus recipient in some hybrid offspring. Most of the progeny plants had a high pollen fertility and seed set, and some contained significantly greater amounts of seed erucic acid than the B. napus parent. This study demonstrates that a part of the C. abyssinica genome can be transferred into B. napus via asymmetric hybridization and maintained in sexual progenies of the hybrids. Furthermore, it confirms that UV irradiation improves the fertility of the hybrid and of its sexual progeny via chromosomal elimination and facilitates the introgression of exotic genetic material into crop species."], "Citation": ["Genome. 2004 Aug;47(4):724-31."], "TitleName": ["Cytogenetic characterization and fae1 gene variation in progenies from asymmetric somatic hybrids between Brassica napus and Crambe abyssinica."], "AuthorsName": ["Wang YP", "1", "Snowdon RJ", "Rudloff E", "Wehling P", "Friedt W", "Sonntag K"], "pmid": ["15284877 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, P.R.

{"Abstract": ["New WHO classification has been widely applied in the diagnosis of leukemia. To elucidate the immunophenotype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and characterize the correlation among morphological, immunological, cytogenetic, and clinical features, we studied the bone marrow immunophenotypes of 180 AML patients in China by flow cytometry. The results showed that CD34, CD2, CD14, CD19, CD56, and HLA-DR were correlated with FAB subtypes. Amongst the 180 patients enrolled in this study, 122 cases were also subjected to karyotype analysis by G-banding technology and abnormal karyotypes were detected in 69 out of 122 patients. Correlation assay showed that t(8;21) was only present in 16 AML-M2 patients, and strongly associated with the individual or combinational expressions of CD15/CD19/CD34/CD56. As to M3, although lymphoid lineage antigens were observed in a considerable number of patients, they were never detected in t(15;17) positive patients. The expressions of CD22, CD56, and TdT showed significant correlation with the overall presence of abnormal karyotype. Additionally, the expressions of CD4, CD7, CD14, CD56, and TdT were positively correlated with clinical features such as white blood cell count, platelet count, and patient's age. In conclusion, immunophenotype analysis was useful for AML diagnosis and classification. At the same time, the data also suggested that the karyotype abnormalities and clinical features were tightly linked with abnormal antigen expression characteristics in AML patients.

To see the influence of anti-leukemic therapy on BM-MSCs, cytogenetic studies were carried out in seven of them after the completion of anti-leukemic therapy, including anthracycline/Ara-C-based chemotherapy in two patients, high-dose busulfan/cyclophosphamide-based allogeneic transplantation in two patients, and total body irradiation (TBI)-based allogeneic transplantation in three patients. To simulate the effect of TBI in vitro, three BM-MSCs from one leukemic patient and two normal adults were irradiated using the same dosage and dosing schedule of TBI and cytogenetics were re-examined after irradiation. At the diagnosis of leukemia, two BM-MSCs had cytogenetic aberration, which were completely different to their BM-HCs counterpart. After the completion of anti-leukemic therapy, cytogenetic aberration was no longer detectable in one patient. Unexpectedly, BM-MSCs from three patients receiving TBI-based allogeneic transplantation acquired new, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities after transplantation. Similarly, complex cytogenetic abnormalities were found in all the three BM-MSCs exposed to in vitro irradiation.

{"Abstract": ["A wheat-Dasypyrum breviaristatum partial amphiploid and its derivatives were analyzed by molecular cytological observation and tested for disease resistance in order to evaluate the potential use of the D. breviaristatum for wheat improvement. A fertility-improved partial amphiploid, TDH-2, was produced from the selfing population of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese spring (CS)-D. breviaristatum amphiploid. Based on the results obtained from genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and seed protein electrophoresis, we found the presence of fourteen D. breviaristatum chromosomes and the absence of D genome in TDH-2, indicating that the genomic composition of TDH-2 was AABBV(b)V(b). GISH analysis on BC(1)F(4) progenies of TDH-2xwheat demonstrated that alien D. breviaristatum chromosomes or segments were frequently transmitted. A survey of diseases resistance revealed that powdery mildew resistance from D. breviaristatum was totally expressed, however, the expression of stripe rust resistance from D. breviaristatum was dependent on the wheat background. The comparison of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was carried out using molecular marker SCAR(1400) linked to Pm21 D. villosum-derived powdery mildew resistance gene, suggested that D. breviaristatum possessed new resistance gene(s) different from that in D. villosum.

The maternal genome was duplicated by cold shock in 0~4\u2103 cold water to form a population of M. amblycephala with 48 chromosomes whose DNA content was identical to the diploid maternal parent. Morphologically, this group of gynogenetic M. amblycephala was similar to the control group. All gynogenetic M. amblycephala were female, and no males were found in any of the examined gynogenetic M. amblycephala, providing cytogenetic evidence that our gynogenetic M. amblycephala are type XY. At the same time, microsatellite analysis showed that 63 alleles were amplified in the three test groups of gynogenetic M. amblycephala. Overall, the population of gynogenetic M. amblycephala observed heterozygosity average, and the expected average was significantly lower than the parental averages, demonstrating that after generation gynogenesis the gene homozygosity of M. amblycephala was significantly higher than the ordinary bream and E. ilishaeformis, making it a pure line. The genetic proximity of gynogenetic M. amblycephala to M. amblycephala demonstrates that gynogenesis passes on maternal DNA.

{"Abstract": ["Donor chimerism after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is commonly used to predict overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Because chimerism is observed at 1 or more times after allo-SCT and not at baseline, if chimerism is in fact associated with OS or DFS, then the occurrence of either disease progression or death informatively censors (terminates) the observed chimerism process. This violates the assumptions underlying standard statistical regression methods for survival analysis, which may lead to biased conclusions. To assess the association between the longitudinal post-allo-SCT donor chimerism process and OS or DFS, we analyzed data from 195 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (n\u00a0=\u00a0157) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n\u00a0=\u00a038) who achieved complete remission after allo-SCT following a reduced-toxicity conditioning regimen of fludarabine/intravenous busulfan. Median follow-up was 31\u00a0months (range, 1.1 to 105\u00a0months). Fitted joint longitudinal-survival time models showed that a binary indicator of complete (100%) donor chimerism and increasing percent of donor T\u00a0cells were significantly associated with longer OS, whereas decreasing percent of donor T\u00a0cells was highly significantly associated with shorter OS. Our analyses illustrate the usefulness of modeling repeated post-allo-SCT chimerism measurements as individual longitudinal processes jointly with OS and DFS to estimate their relationships.

However, only three 1AS primers could not be amplified in line 13-2-2, whereas the others were amplified. Thus, these markers suggested that the line 13-2-2 was 1AL.1RS translocation line. Line 13-2-2 was immune to powdery mildew after inoculation with Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici isolates E05 and E07 during the adult plant stages. In contrast, the maternal parent W770B, Kavkaz with Pm8, and Amigo with Pm17 were heavily infected with spores and had reaction response scores of susceptible. Thus, the new wheat-rye 1AL.1RS translocation line with resistance to powdery mildew could be a new and valuable donor source for wheat improvement.

{"Abstract": ["Prader-Willi syndrome is a common and complex disorder affecting multiple systems. Its main manifestations are infantile hypotonia with a poor sucking reflex, a characteristic facial appearance, mild mental retardation, hypogonadism and early-onset obesity. Prader-Willi syndrome is due to the absence of paternally expressed imprinted genes at 15q11.2-13, and 3 main mechanisms are known to be involved in its pathogenesis: paternal microdeletions, maternal uniparental disomy events, and imprinting defects. DNA methylation analysis can detect almost all individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome but is unable to distinguish between the molecular classes of the disease. Thus, additional methods are necessary to identify the molecular classes. Here, we employed chromosomal microarray analysis-single nucleotide polymorphism for diagnosis and detected a long-contiguous stretch of homozygosity on chromosome 15, which is highly predictive of maternal uniparental disomy on chromosome 15. Other methods, including fluorescence in situ hybridization, chromosomal microarray analysis-comparative genomic hybridization, genotyping and family linkage analysis, were performed for further validation. In conclusion, our study highlights the use of long-contiguous stretch of homozygosity detection for the diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome.

MiR-30d was enriched in coronary sinus blood and increased in late-contracting myocardium in a canine model of HFDYS, indicating cardiac origin with maximal expression in areas of high mechanical stress. We examined the functional effects of miR-30d in cultured cardiomyocytes and determined that miR-30d is expressed in cardiomyocytes and released in vesicles in response to mechanical stress. Overexpression of miR-30d in cultured cardiomyocytes led to cardiomyocyte growth and protected against apoptosis by targeting the mitogen-associated kinase 4, a downstream effector of tumor necrosis factor.

{"Abstract": ["Collagen, type III, alpha-1 (COL3A1) is essential for normal collagen I fibrillogenesis in many organs. There are differences in phenotypes of mutations in the COL3A1 gene in humans and mutations in mice. In order to investigate whether the regulation and gene network of COL3A1 is the same in healthy populations of mice and humans, we compared the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that regulate the expression level of COL3A1 and the gene network of COL3A1 pathways between humans and mice using whole genome expression profiles. Our results showed that, for the regulation of expression of Col3a1 in mice, an eQTL on chromosome (Chr) 12 regulates the expression of Col3a1. However, expression of genes in the syntenic region on human Chr 7 has no association with the expression level of COL3A1. For the gene network comparison, we identified 44 top genes whose expression levels are strongly associated with that of Col3a1 in mice. We next identified 41 genes strongly associated with the expression level of COL3A1 in humans. There are a few but significant differences in the COL3A1 gene network between humans and mice. Several genes showed opposite association with expression of COL3A1. These genes are known to play important roles in development and function of the extracellular matrix of the lung. Difference in the molecular pathway of key genes in the COL3A1 gene network in humans and mice suggest caution should be used in extrapolating results from models of human lung diseases in mice to clinical lung diseases in humans. These differences may influence the efficacy of drugs in humans whose development employed mouse models.

{"Abstract": ["We performed a study to investigate the role of ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC5, XPA and XPC polymorphisms from perspective of the whole NER pathway in the prognosis of gastric cancer. A total of 410 gastric cancer patients were recruited between January 2010 and December 2011. Restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) was used to analyze genotypes of ERCC1 rs11615 and rs3212986, ERCC2 rs13181 and s1799793, ERCC5 rs17655, XPA rs1800975 and XPC rs2228001. Our study found that carriers of ERCC1 rs3212986 TT genotype showed significantly favorable survival than wide-type GG genotype in multivariate analysis (OR=6.38, 95% CI=2.54-19.03), and patients with variant CC genotype of ERCC2 rs13181 exhibited better response to chemotherapy than those with AA genotype (OR=2.21, 95% CI=1.17-4.25). By Cox proportional hazards model, patients with variant TT genotype of ERCC1 rs3212986 exhibited longer PFS and OS than those who had GG genotype (for PFS, HR=0.37, 95% CI=0.17-0.75; for OS, HR=0.36, 95% CI=0.13-0.87). For ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphism, carriers with CC genotype demonstrated significantly increased hazards of progression of disease and death in multivariate model (for PFS, HR=0.48, 95% CI=0.26-0.88; for OS, HR=0.44, 95% CI=0.20-0.91).

{"Abstract": ["Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira, is a worldwide zoonotic infection. The genus Leptospira includes at least 21 species clustered into three groups--pathogens, non-pathogens, and intermediates--based on 16S rRNA phylogeny. Research on Leptospira is difficult due to slow growth and poor transformability of the pathogens. Recent identification of extrachromosomal elements besides the two chromosomes in L. interrogans has provided new insight into genome complexity of the genus Leptospira. The large size, low copy number, and high similarity of the sequence of these extrachromosomal elements with the chromosomes present challenges in isolating and detecting them without careful genome assembly. In this study, two extrachromosomal elements were identified in L. borgpetersenii serovar Ballum strain 56604 through whole genome assembly combined with S1 nuclease digestion following pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE) analysis. Further, extrachromosomal elements in additional 15 Chinese epidemic strains of Leptospira, comprising L. borgpetersenii, L. weilii, and L. interrogans, were successfully separated and identified, independent of genome sequence data. Southern blot hybridization with extrachromosomal element-specific probes, designated as lcp1, lcp2 and lcp3-rep, further confirmed their occurrences as extrachromosomal elements. In total, 24 plasmids were detected in 13 out of 15 tested strains, among which 11 can hybridize with the lcp1-rep probe and 11 with the lcp2-rep probe, whereas two can hybridize with the lcp3-rep probe. None of them are likely to be species-specific. Blastp search of the lcp1, lcp2, and lcp3-rep genes with a nonredundant protein database of Leptospira species genomes showed that their homologous sequences are widely distributed among clades of pathogens but not non-pathogens or intermediates. These results suggest that the plasmids are widely distributed in Leptospira species, and further elucidation of their biological significance might contribute to our understanding of biology and infectivity of pathogenic spirochetes."], "Citation": ["PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015 Nov 10;9(11):e0004220. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004220. eCollection 2015."], "TitleName": ["Distribution of Plasmids in Distinct Leptospira Pathogenic Species."], "AuthorsName": ["Wang Y", "1", "Zhuang X", "1", "Zhong Y", "2", "Zhang C", "3", "Zhang Y", "1", "Zeng L", "4", "Zhu Y", "1", "He P", "1", "Dong K", "1", "Pal U", "5", "Guo X", "1", "Qin J", "1"], "pmid": ["26555137 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]", "PMC4640553"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institutes of Medical Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.", "2", "Computational Biology Department, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States of America.", "3", "National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ICDC, CCDC), Beijing, China.", "4", "The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.", "5", "Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Maryland, College Park and Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, College Park, Maryland, United States of America."], "email": ["upal@umd.edu", "d:otliam"], "FullTextLink": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/26555137/", "http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004220"]},

{"Abstract": ["There is no available method of age-prediction for biological samples. The accumulating evidences indicate that DNA methylation patterns change with age. Aging resembles a developmentally regulated process that is tightly controlled by specific epigenetic modifications and age-associated methylation changes exist in human genome. In this study, three age-related methylation fragments were isolated and identified in blood of 40 donors. Age-related methylation changes with each fragment was validated and replicated in a general population sample of 65 donors over a wide age range (11-72\u00a0years). Methylation of these fragments is linearly correlated with age over a range of six decades (r\u2009=\u20090.80-0.88). Using average methylation of CpG sites of three fragments, a regression model that explained 95\u00a0% of the variance in age was built and is able to predict an individual's age with great accuracy (R (2\u2009)=\u20090.93). The predicted value is highly correlated with the observed age in the sample (r\u2009=\u20090.96) and has great accuracy of average 4\u00a0years difference between predicted age and true age. This study implicates that DNA methylation can be an available biological marker of age-prediction. Further measurement of relevant markers in the genome could be a tool in routine screening to predict age of forensic biological samples.

{"Abstract": ["Global distribution patterns of Cladophialophora carrionii, agent of human chromoblastomycosis in arid climates of Africa, Asia, Australia, Central-and South-America, were compared with similar data of the vicarious Fonsecaea spp., agents of the disease in tropical rain forests. Population diversities among 73 C. carrionii strains and 60 strains of three Fonsecaea species were analyzed for rDNA ITS, partial \u03b2-tubulin, and amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprints. Populations differed significantly between continents. Lowest haplotype diversity was found in South American populations, while African strains were the most diverse. Gene flow was noted between the African population and all other continents. The general pattern of Fonsecaea agents of chromoblastomycosis differed significantly from that of C. carrionii and revealed deeper divergence among three differentiated species with smaller numbers of haplotypes, indicating a longer evolutionary history.

{"Abstract": ["Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) displayed 'sepsis-like' immune paralysis. Little is known about the role of CD4+ T lymphocytes, the primary regulator of innate and adopted immune system, played in ACLF. Acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac), a key epigenetic modification, tightly controls gene transcription. Whether and how does H3K9ac modification regulate CD4+ T cells in ACLF remains unclear. PBMCs were isolated from patients with ACLF, immune tolerance of chronic hepatitis B (CHB-T) and immune active of chronic hepatitis B (CHB-A). Then, CD4+ T lymphocytes were purified by magnetic microbeads, and the purity was confirmed by flow cytometry. H3K9ac variations were analysed in CD4+ T cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray and then confirmed by quantitative PCR. Whole-genome H3K9 acetylation analyses were conducted by bioinformatics. A total of 70 genes were differently modified in H3K9ac between CHB-A and ACLF groups, while 44 genes were differently modified in H3K9ac between CHB-T and ACLF groups. Clustering algorithm analysis showed patients with ACLF displayed 'sepsis-like' immune paralysis. Functional analysis showed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, or downstream pathway-related genes, such as BIP, ATF4, PER1, CSNK1D, IRF3, BNIP1, AKT1 and UBC, were differentially modified in ACLF. We profiled H3K9 acetyl modification in CD4+ T lymphocytes from HBV-infected patients with three different immune states, that is ACLF, immune tolerance and immune active phases. ACLF displayed 'sepsis-like' immune paralysis. ER stress in CD4+ T lymphocytes attributed to ACLF.

PyroMark ID Pyrosequencer as an accurate detection platform for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has been applied to identify and resolve microorganisms involved in closely Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7). To explore more applications and improve the efficiency for pyrosequencing in this field, we developed a method integrated multiplex pyrosequencing with a universal primer. Two multiplex pyrosequencing assays with a universal biotinylated primer were designed to analyze five SNPs located in four gene of E. coli O157:H7 strain. The accuracy of the established assays was validated by genotyping reference strain E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 and E. coli K-12. We also demonstrated that two multiplex pyrosequencing assays were specific and sensitive for genotyping closely related E. coli O157 strains. Reproducibility of results and multiplexing capability were evaluated by a comparison of this method with the monoplex pyrosequencing. Furthermore, these two multiplex pyrosequencing assays have been successfully applied to detect 11 E. coli O157 strains isolated from 1504 Chinese livestock samples. This method reduces costs and time consumption in the process of pyrosequencing analysis, and potentially serves as a rapid tool and reliable candidate strategy for the microbial identification and other genotyping application.

{"Abstract": ["In this study, 2 approaches were adopted to obtain good single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) data for autotetraploid alfalfa; primers were added to PCR products, and fluorescent-labeled primers were utilized. PCR-SSCP conditions for a 331-bp fragment in the coding region of polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein gene 2 in alfalfa (MsPGIP2) were optimized, and the results showed that the best SSCP gel pattern could be obtained when the loading mixture was made by mixing 1 \u03bcL PCR products, 0.2 to 0.8 \u03bcL unlabeled primers (50 \u03bcM) and 4 to 16 \u03bcL loading buffer. Furthermore, the use of the fluorescent-labeled primers resulted in 2 separated electrophoresis images from 2 complementary single DNA strands, thus making the determination of alleles and idiotypes a relatively easy task. In addition, the results of sequencing prove that the determination of alleles and idiotypes were accurate based on SSCP analysis. Finally, a total of 9 alleles with 18 SNP sites were identified for MsPGIP2 in the alfalfa variety 'Algonquin'. In conclusion, MsPGIP2 possessed great genetic variation, and the addition of primers to the PCR products in combination with the fluorescent labeling of primers could significantly improve the sensitivity and resolution of SSCP analysis. This technique could be used for genetic diversity detection and marker-assisted breeding of useful genes in autopolyploid species such as alfalfa.

A total of 229 bands were detected, with an average of 7.9 bands per marker. The average polymorphic rate for the species was 92.1%. The polymorphism information content ranged from 0.771 to 0.893. The genetic similarity ranged from 0.55 to 0.84, which confirmed a high level of genetic diversity among orchardgrass cultivars. The unweighted pair-group method, in combination with the arithmetic mean algorithm (UPGMA) dendrogram and principal coordinate analysis, showed a separation of 6 major clusters among 32 cultivars. The number of distinguishable cultivars ranged from 3 to 23, with an average of 12.1 per primer. Moreover, 11 bands that showed stable and repeatable SSR patterns were amplified by A01E14, A01K14, and D02K13. These bands were used to develop the DNA fingerprints for 32 orchardgrass cultivars. In the DNA fingerprints constructed, each cultivar had a unique fingerprinting pattern that was easily distinguished from the others.

Growing evidence indicates that some CpG sites may have age-related methylation changes and thus may be a promising tool for age prediction. In this study, we utilized the pyrosequencing approach to screen age-related CpG (AR-CpG) sites for age prediction. Five AR-CpGs were identified as age-related markers from thirty-eight candidates, among which three CpG sites, ITGA2B_1, NPTX2_3, and NPTX2_4 were never reported in previous studies. We fit a linear regression model for age prediction based on methylation assay for 89 blood samples from donors aged 9-75 years old. The model included four AR-CpG markers in three gene fragments ASPA, ITGA2B and NPTX2 and enabled the age prediction with R(2)=0.819. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) from chronological age of the model was 7.870. We validated the linear regression model with a validation set of 40 blood samples, and the prediction MAD was 7.986. There was no statistically significant difference in age prediction between 20 pairs of blood samples and bloodstains. Six pairs of fresh and old bloodstains were analyzed using our assay. The obtained results showed the assay still performed an effective prediction on bloodstains after four-month storage in room conditions. This study indicates that our DNA methylation assay is a reliable and effective method for age prediction for forensic purposes.

DNA markers could provide distinct benefits in tomato variety identification; however, DNA fingerprint analyses have not made DNA marker data readily usable for identification of varieties in tomato and other crops. A manual cultivar and/or variety identification diagram (MCID) strategy has been developed and has been found to make DNA markers more usable for the identification of genotyped plant individuals. We adopted this strategy, using modified RAPD markers to identify 42 tomato varieties from different geographical origins and seed merchants. All of the varieties were clearly separated and individually identified by reproducible fingerprints of only 6 RAPD primers. The tomato MCID that is generated is usable for the identification of any two or more tomato varieties. In addition, fewer primers can be used to make a distinction between varieties using this approach, since the selected fingerprints from each primer are used after they have been generated.

Their chemotypes and geographic distributions are dramatically different, and these highlight the challenges that Fusarium head blight (FHB) poses to plant disease specialists and plant breeders, thereby requiring that quarantine officials employ molecular diagnostic tools in their active surveillance programs. Molecular marker technologies play essential roles in species identification of the Fg complex, and they are being used widely to assess the genetic diversity of the clade. The utility, applicability and limitations of molecular methods for assessing the population structure and genetic diversity within the Fg complex are discussed with suitable examples.

{"Abstract": ["The flower developmental process, which is crucial to the whole lifecycle of higher plants, is influenced by both environmental and endogenous factors. The genus Oncidium is commercially important for cut flower and houseplant industry and is ideal for flower development studies. Using cDNA-amplified restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, we profiled transcripts that are differentially expressed during flower development of Oncidium Milliongolds. A total of 15,960 transcript-derived fragments were generated, with 114 primer sets. Of these, 1248 were sequenced, producing 993 readable sequences. BLASTX/N analysis showed that 833 of the 993 transcripts showed homology to genes in the NCBI databases, exhibiting functions involved in various processes, such as signal transduction, energy conversion, metabolism, and gene expression regulation. The full-length mRNAs of SUCROSE SYNTHASE 1 (SUS1) and LEAFY (LFY) were cloned, and their expression patterns were characterized. The results showed that the expression levels of SUS1 and LFY were similar during flower development. To confirm the function of SUS1 in flower buds, carbohydrate content and sucrose synthase activity were determined. The results showed that changes in sucrose content and sucrose synthase activity reflected SUS1 expression levels. Collectively, these results indicate that SUS1 influences flower development by regulating LFY expression levels through changing the sucrose content of flower buds."], "Citation": ["Genet Mol Res. 2014 Feb 21;13(3):6303-15. doi: 10.4238/2014.February.21.5."], "TitleName": ["cDNA-AFLP transcriptional profiling reveals genes expressed during flower development in Oncidium Milliongolds."], "AuthorsName": ["Qian X", "1", "Gong MJ", "1", "Wang CX", "1", "Tian M", "2"], "pmid": ["24634291 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "Research Institution of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Fuyang, Zhejiang Province, China.", "2", "Research Institution of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Fuyang, Zhejiang Province, China tmin115@163.com."], "email": [], "FullTextLink": ["http://www.geneticsmr.com/articles/2915"]},

Eight AFLP primer combinations generated 1367 fragments, giving a mean of 172 fragments per primer combination. Polymorphism in the germplasm analysis was found for 1360 (99.48%) of the fragments, of which 264 (19.27%) fragments were unique (accession specific) and 423 (25.33%) of the fragments were rare (present in less than 10% of the accessions). The polymorphic fragments were used to group the accessions in a UPGMA phenogram. Most grouping was geographical. In general, accessions coming from Guizhou and Guangxi showed higher diversities as these accessions were scattered in different groups. The genetic distance estimated by Jaccard similarity coefficient index showed low variability among genotypes (coefficient value ranged from 0.60 to 0.95).

{"Abstract": ["Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is caused by toxin-producing strains. It accounts for 20-30\u200a% of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and particularly accounts for 90\u200a% of pseudomembranous colitis. The epidemiological study of C. difficile is thus important. In this study, we report the molecular epidemiology and ward distribution of C. difficile in a tertiary hospital of China. A total of 161 toxigenic strains were isolated from 1845 patients originating from different wards and the strains were characterized based on toxin profile and multilocus sequence typing. Variable isolation rates were observed in different wards and the occurrence was higher in intensive care unit and geriatric wards. Toxin gene profiling revealed that, out of the 161 isolates, 134 (83.2)% were positive for both toxin A (tcdA) and toxin B (tcdB) (A+B+) followed by toxin A-negative and B-positive (A-B+) (16.8\u200a%) isolates. However, only three of the toxigenic strains (1.9\u200a%) were positive for both the cdtA and cdtB genes. Based on the molecular epidemiology study, a total of 30 different sequence types (STs), including one new ST (ST-220), were distinguishable. ST-54 was the most prevalent (23.0\u200a%), followed by ST-35 (19.3\u200a%) and ST-37 (10.0\u200a%). None of the isolates belonged to ST-1 (ribotype 027) or ST-11 (ribotype 078). Taken together, the toxin profile and the molecular epidemiological data showed that all the ST-37 clades were of toxin type A-B+, which accounted for 59.3\u200a% of all type A-B+ isolates.

Selective amplification with 64 primer combinations allowed the visualization of 4407 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs), and 2027 were differentially expressed. Overall, 107 TDFs were re-sequenced successfully, and 86 unique sequences were identified in 10 functional categories based on their putative functions. A subset of these genes was selected for real-time PCR validation, which confirmed the differential expression patterns in the leaf tissues under NaCl stress vs. no stress. Differential expressed genes will be studied further for association with salt or drought-tolerance in P. simonii x P. nigra. This study suggests that cDNA-AFLP is a useful tool to serve as an initial step for characterizing transcriptional changes induced by NaCl salinity stress in P. simonii x P. nigra and provides resources for further study and application in genetic improvement and breeding.

{"Abstract": ["The rice grasshopper, Oxya hyla intricata, is a rice pest in Southeast Asia. In this study, population genetic diversity and structure of this Oxya species was examined using both DNA sequences and AFLP technology. The samples of 12 populations were collected from four Southeast Asian countries, among which 175 individuals were analysed using mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences, and 232 individuals were examined using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) to test whether the phylogeographical pattern and population genetics of this species are related to past geological events and/or climatic oscillations. No obvious trend of genetic diversity was found along a latitude/longitude gradient among different geographical groups. Phylogenetic analysis indicated three deep monophyletic clades that approximately correspond to three geographical regions separated by high mountains and a deep strait, and TCS analysis also revealed three disconnected networks, suggesting that spatial and temporal separations by vicariance, which were also supported by AMOVA as a source of the molecular variance presented among groups. Gene flow analysis showed that there had been frequent historical gene flow among local populations in different regions, but the networks exhibited no shared haplotype among populations. In conclusion, the past geological events and climatic fluctuations are the most important factor on the phylogeographical structure and genetic patterns of O. hyla intricata in Southeast Asia. Habitat, vegetation, and anthropogenic effect may also contribute to gene flow and introgression of this species. Moreover, temperature, abundant rainfall and a diversity of graminaceous species are beneficial for the migration of O. hyla intricata.

In this regard, however, far less attention has been paid to the southern and south-eastern declivities of the QTP, i.e. the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains (HHM) region. Here, we report a survey of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence variation in the HHM endemic Sinopodophyllum hexandrum, a highly selfing alpine perennial herb with mainly gravity-dispersed berries (105 individuals, 19 localities). We specifically aimed to test a vicariant evolutionary hypothesis across the 'Mekong-Salween Divide', a known biogeographic and phytogeographic boundary of north-to-south trending river valleys separating the East Himalayas and Hengduan Mts. Both cpDNA and AFLPs identified two divergent phylogroups largely congruent with these mountain ranges. There was no genetic depauperation in the more strongly glaciated East Himalayas (AFLPs: H(E)=0.031; cpDNA: h(S)=0.133) compared to the mainly ice-free Hengduan Mts. (AFLPs: H(E)=0.037; cpDNA: h(S)=0.082), while population differentiation was consistently higher in the former region (AFLPs: \u03a6(ST)=0.522 vs. 0.312; cpDNA: \u03a6(ST)=0.785 vs. 0.417). Our results suggest that East Himalayan and Hengduan populations of S. hexandrum were once fragmented, persisted in situ during glacials in both areas, and have not merged again, except for a major instance of inter-lineage chloroplast capture identified at the MSD boundary. Our coalescent time estimate for all cpDNA haplotypes (c. 0.37-0.48 mya), together with paleogeological evidence, strongly rejects paleo-drainage formation as a mechanism underlying allopatric fragmentation, whereas mountain glaciers following the ridges of the MSD during glacials (and possible interglacials) could have been responsible. This study thus indicates an important role for mountain glaciers in driving (incipient) allopatric speciation across the MSD in the HHM region by causing vicariant lineage divergence and acting as barriers to post-divergence gene flow."], "Citation": ["Mol Phylogenet Evol. 2011 May;59(2):412-24. doi: 10.1016/j.ympev.2011.01.009.

However, it is difficult to study GPIb-specific platelet stimulation using physiological ligands in vivo. GPIb-binding snake C-type lectins (snaclecs) are useful tools for exploring GPIb in vitro because they act on platelets differently. In the present study, a novel GPIb-binding snaclec, named jerdonibitin, was purified, molecular cloned and characterized from Trimeresurus jerdonii venom. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it showed a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 25 kDa under non-reducing conditions and two distinct bands with apparent molecular weights of 15 kDa (\u03b1-subunit) and 13 kDa (\u03b2-subunit) under reducing conditions. The cDNA sequences of each subunit of jerdonibitin were identified and both deduced amino acid sequences were confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing and trypsin-digested peptide mass fingerprinting of MALDI-TOF. Sequence alignment showed that jerdonibitin is a snaclec and has sequence similarity with TSV-GPIb-BP (a GPIb-inhibitory snaclec). Jerdonibitin dose-dependently inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ristocetin or low-dose thrombin, but not by high-dose thrombin.

The MICs of the strains to imipenem were between 16 \u03bcg/ml and 128 \u03bcg/ml. When CCCP was added, a MIC decrease of at least four-fold was observed in 20 isolates, which belonged to the A- or C-type. AdeB and bla (PER-1) genes were each detected in 35 isolates, bla (OXA-23) gene in 34 isolates and bla (OXA-58)-like gene in 24 isolates. All isolates harbored bla (OXA-51)-like genes. No isolates carried the bla (IMP-1) gene. Integron was detected in 25 isolates, which mediated the resistance to aminoglycosides and rifampin.

{"Abstract": ["To understand the distribution of the serotypes of Shigella spp. and to investigate the drug-resistant genes of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs) in Shigella in Zhejiang province, we have collected clinically isolated Shigella isolates from 2 hospitals in Zhejiang province during August to December of 2006. There are 11 Shigella flexneri and 13 Shigella sonnei isolates, respectively. Among the 11 S. flexneri, 9 are serotype F4 and the remaining 2 are F1a and F2a. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed that 20.8% of the isolates were resistant to cefotaxime and 20.8% of the isolates were intermediate to cefotaxime. Isoelectric focusing demonstrated that the ESBL-positive isolates and their transconjugants produce a single \u03b2-lactamase with a pI of 7.9 or 9.0. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that they harbor either CTX-M-14 or CTX-M-15 gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis showed that 9 F4 S. flexneri isolates belong to the same clone and 13 S. sonnei isolates from different regions in Zhejiang province belong to different subclones of the same clone. In summary, resistance and reduced susceptibility to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics were mainly caused by the production of CTX-M-type ESBLs.

{"Abstract": ["CYP3A4 is a major member of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes which play crucial roles in cardiovascular diseases. Recently, a novel polymorphism in the CYP3A4 gene, IVS10+12G>A, named CYP3A4*1G (rs2242480), has been identified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential relationship between the CYP3A4*1G allele and the susceptibility of coronary heart disease (CHD). A total of 628 individuals (322 unrelated patients with CHD and 306 age- and sex-matched healthy controls) were investigated in the study. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to identify CYP3A4*1G. We also analysed the functional significance of IVS10+12G>A using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that the frequency of the CYP3A4*1G allele was 0.290 and the CYP3A4*1G/*1G genotype was 0.090 in the patients with CHD. The patients with the CYP3A4*1G/*1G genotype had higher CHD risk, with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.84 (p=0.025; 95% CI=1.32-12.65) after adjustment for conventional risk factors. A gender-dependent difference was also observed. The CYP3A4*1G/*1G frequency was significantly higher in female patients than in the controls (p=0.034, OR=3.02, 95% CI=1.04-8.70). Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that the A allele at IVS10+12G>A had a significantly higher transcriptional activity than the G allele.

To improve conservation outcomes and in particular, germplasm collection guidelines, information on spatial genetic structure of the species is required. In this study, we investigated the spatial genetic structure and genetic diversity of 161 individuals of K. septentrionalis collected from five natural populations using AFLP molecular markers. Within-population genetic variation was measured, with percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) ranged from 63% to 87%, while H (S) (genetic diversity within population) varied from 0.185 to 0.244 with a mean of 0.215 \u00b1 0.025. Significant genetic differentiations were revealed between pairwise populations, indicating each population existing as an independent evolutionarily significant unit. Mantel test results showed no pattern of isolation-by-distance among populations separated by large distance. Fine scale spatial patterns of genetic variation suggested significant effects of isolation-by-distance within population at distances of 22 m.

Sixty-two primer pairs and 63 probes were designed to interrogate each open reading frame (ORF) of SCCmec type IV sequences. A set of 131 MRSA SCCmec type IV isolates were classified into 79 subtypes by this method. There was considerable concordance between SCCmec type IV subtyping, spa typing, and PFGE patterns for clinical isolates, and the stability of SCCmec type IV subtyping was comparable to that of the other two methods. Using an in-house computer program, we showed that a subset of 20 genetic markers could achieve the same level of discrimination between isolates as the full set of 62, with a Simpson's index of diversity of 0.975. SCCmec type IV has a much higher level of diversity than previously suggested. The application of the mPCR/RLB hybridization assay to MRSA SCCmec type IV subtyping can improve the discriminatory power and throughput of MRSA typing and has the potential to enhance rapid infection control surveillance and outbreak detection."], "Citation": ["J Clin Microbiol. 2010 Oct;48(10):3628-34. doi: 10.1128/JCM.00351-10.

{"Abstract": ["Following the rapid uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the reorganization of the major river drainages in southwest China was primarily caused by river capture events. However, the impact of these past changes in drainage patterns on the current distribution and genetic structure of the endemic flora of this region remains largely unknown. Here we report a survey of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) in Terminalia franchetii, an endemic shrub or small tree of the deep and dry-hot river valleys of this region. We surveyed AFLP variation within and among 21 populations (251 individuals) of T. franchetii, distributed disjunctively between northern and southern drainage systems. Using STRUCTURE, principal coordinates analysis, and genetic distance methods, we identified two main population genetic groups (I and II) and four subgroups within the species, as follows: (I) the Upper Jinshajiang Valley (subgroup I((north))) and the Honghe drainage area (subgroup I((south))); (II) the Middle and Lower Jinshajiang and Yalongjiang Valleys (subgroup II((north))) and the Nanpanjiang drainage area (subgroup II((south))). Genetic diversity was lower in group I than in group II. According to the genetic diversity and genetic structure results, we suggest that the modern disjunctive distribution and associated patterns of genetic structure of T. franchetii result from vicariance caused by several historical drainage capture events, involving the separation of the Upper Jinshajiang, Yalongjiang and Daduhe from the Honghe or Nanpanjiang in southwest China."], "Citation": ["J Plant Res. 2011 Jan;124(1):63-73. doi: 10.1007/s10265-010-0360-3.

{"Abstract": ["An array of studies have reported that the spaceflight environment is mutagenic and may induce phenotypic and genetic changes in diverse organisms. We reported recently that in at least some plant species (e.g., rice) the spaceflight environment can be particularly potent in generating heritable epigenetic changes in the form of altered cytosine methylation patterns and activation of transposable elements. To further study the issue of spaceflight-induced genomic instability, and in particular to test whether the incurred genetic and epigenetic changes are connected or independent of each other, we performed the present study. We subjected seeds of the standard laboratory rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Nipponbare to a spaceflight in the spaceship Long March 2 for 18 days. We then investigated the genetic and DNA methylation stabilities of 11 randomly selected plants germinated from the spaceflown seeds by using two kinds of DNA markers, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP). For AFLP, by using 15 primer combinations, we assessed 460 genomic loci and found that the frequencies of genetic changes across the 11 plants ranged from 0.7% to 6.7% with an average frequency of 3.5%. For MSAP, by using 14 primer combinations, we assessed 467 loci and detected the occurrence of four major types of cytosine methylation alterations at the CCGG sites, namely CG or CNG hypomethylation and CG or CNG hypermethylation. Collectively, the frequencies of the two kinds of hypermethylation, CG (1.95%) and CNG (1.44%), are about two times higher than those of the two kinds of hypomethylation, CG (0.76%) and CNG (0.80%), though different plants showed variable frequencies for each type of alteration. Further analysis suggested that both the genetic and cytosine methylation changes manifested apparent mutational bias towards specific genomic regions, but the two kinds of instabilities are independent of each other based on correlation analysis."], "Citation": ["Genome. 2010 Jul;53(7):524-32. doi: 10.1139/g10-030."], "TitleName": ["Spaceflight-induced genetic and epigenetic changes in the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome are independent of each other."], "AuthorsName": ["Ou X", "1", "Long L", "Wu Y", "Yu Y", "Lin X", "Qi X", "Liu B"], "pmid": ["20616874 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of MOE and Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, China."], "email": ["(email: baoliu@nenu.edu.cn)", "baoliu@nenu.edu.cn"], "FullTextLink": ["http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/g10-030?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed"]},

We have determined the phenotypic effects and genetic characteristics of dwarf mutant (bnaC.dwf). The dwarf mutant was insensitive to exogenous GA(3) for plant height, suggesting that it is significantly playing a crucial role in the gibberellins response pathway. Genetic analysis revealed that one recessive gene is responsible for controlling the phenotypic expression of dwarf mutant. Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) technique was applied for selecting markers linked to the BnaC.DWF gene which assisted in screening of dwarf and normal individuals in the BC(4) population. We have screened 1,024 primer combinations and then identified nine AFLP markers linked to the BnaC.DWF gene. Identification and linkage of the markers were carried out by analysing 2,000 individuals from a larger population of the BC(4).

Susceptibilities to antibiotics were performed using agar dilution methods. The macrolide resistance genes ermB, ermTR, mefA, and tetracycline-resistant gene tetM and the int and xis genes of Tn916 family were detected by polymerase chain reaction. All 456 strains were analyzed by emm typing. Selected strains representing each emm type were further characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The resistance rates of erythromycin and clindamycin both significantly increased during the 2 sample periods (79.7% versus 94% for erythromycin and 75.4% versus 96.9% for clindamycin). Telithromycin resistance rate increased from 20.37% to 87.93%.

{"Abstract": ["Powdery mildew disease caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is an economically important disease in wheat worldwide. The identification of germplasms resistant to the disease can not only facilitate the breeding of resistant cultivars, but can also broaden the diversity of resistance genes. The Mexican M53 is a synthetic hexaploid wheat line developed at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) from the cross between Triticum durum and Aegilops tauschii249. Infection of M53 with 15 different pathogen races revealed that the resistance in M53 was race-dependent and effective against the majority of the tested Bgt races, including the race 15 predominant in the Beijing wheat growing area. Inoculation of the parents of M53 with the race 15 demonstrated that M53 and Ae. tauschii249 were resistant, whereas T. durum was susceptible. The inoculation of three segregating F(2) populations developed from the crosses between M53 and three susceptible Chinese wheat cultivars with the race 15 showed that the resistant gene in M53 segregated in a single dominant manner. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to map the gene in a segregating F(2) population consisting of 213 lines developed from the cross Wan7107\u2009\u00d7\u2009M53. Two closely linked AFLP markers, Apm109 and Apm161, were identified to flank the gene with genetic distances of 1.0\u00a0cM and 3.0\u00a0cM, respectively. The recognized gene was assigned to the long arm of chromosome 5D as determined by three linked SSR markers, Xwmc289b, Xgwm583, and Xgwm292, and by the physical mapping of Apm109 using Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic stocks.

{"Abstract": ["Molecular typing of Vibrio cholerae strains is a powerful tool for the surveillance of cholera. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) is considered to be a powerful subtyping technique to distinguish bacterial strains at the genetic level. Optimization and standardization of AFLP protocol is required to allow data comparisons across different laboratories in a surveillance network. Here, we performed AFLP using different restriction enzymes and primer pairs for subtyping of V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 and compared the optimized AFLP protocol with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to evaluate the applicability of AFLP for conducting epidemiological surveillance of cholera. The discriminatory index (D-value) of PFGE for serogroup O1 strains was similar when digested with NotI and SfiI, whereas that for O139 strains was higher for NotI digestion than for SfiI. EcoRI-G/MseI-T was the restriction enzyme and primer combination with highest discriminatory index used in the AFLP analysis. Capillary electrophoresis-based AFLP showed higher discriminatory power than that of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-based AFLP. When the two methods were compared using 72 epidemiologically unrelated serogroup O1 El Tor isolates, AFLP had a lower D-value than PFGE with NotI and SfiI digestions, respectively. For 54 epidemiologically unrelated serogroup O139 isolates, NotI PFGE had the highest discriminatory power, and SfiI PFGE and AFLP yielded almost the same but lower discriminatory power. We conclude that NotI and SfiI are both suitable for the PFGE of V. cholerae serogroup O1, whereas NotI should be defined as the primary enzyme for serogroup O139.

The bacteria obtained from culture-independent method belong to Proteobacteria (95.8%), Actinobacteria (2.1%), and Firmicutes (2.1%) and fungi belong to Ascomycota (65.2%) and Basidiomycota (34.8%). Very few overlapped microbial species were found by culture-dependent and -independent methods. Healthy leaves display higher bacterial diversity than diseased leaves. Phylogenetic structures are very different between healthy and diseased phyllosphere microbial communities. Bacteria close to Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas were dominant on healthy leaves, whereas those close to Shigella were dominant on diseased leaves. 52.9% of fungal clones from healthy leaves were Ustilaginomycetes, close to Rhodotorula phylloplana and uncultured basidomycete; by contrast, 60% of clones from diseased leaves were Lecanoromycetes, close to Umbilicaria muehlenbergii.

Although we detected 49 clones, introduced populations exhibited very low genetic diversity and little differentiation compared with those from the native range, and approximately 80% of introduced populations were composed of a single clone. A widespread clone ('W') detected in two Peruvian populations accounted for 70.9% of the individuals sampled and dominated in 74.5% of the introduced populations. However, samples from Bangladesh and Indonesia were composed of different genotypes, implicating multiple introductions to the introduced range. Nine of 47 introduced populations contained clonal diversity suggesting that sexual recruitment occurs in some invasive sites where environmental conditions favour seedling establishment. The global patterns of genetic diversity in E. crassipes likely result from severe genetic bottlenecks during colonization and prolific clonal propagation. The prevalence of the 'W' genotype throughout the invasive range may be explained by stochastic sampling, or possibly because of pre-adaptation of the 'W' genotype to tolerate low temperatures."], "Citation": ["Mol Ecol. 2010 May;19(9):1774-86. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04609.x."], "TitleName": ["Genetic uniformity characterizes the invasive spread of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), a clonal aquatic plant."], "AuthorsName": ["Zhang YY", "1", "Zhang DY", "Barrett SC"], "pmid": ["20529068 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "MOE Key Laboratory for Biodiversity Science and Ecological Engineering, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."], "email": ["ac.otnorotu@tterrab.recneps", "rotu@tterrab.recneps:otliam"], "FullTextLink": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04609.x"]},

Phylogenetic analysis of the representative strain DN316(T) using sequences of the glnA, thrC and recA genes and the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region confirmed the phylogenetic arrangement obtained from analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. DNA-DNA relatedness between DN316(T) and R. radiobacter LMG 140(T) was 43.7\u200a%, clearly indicating that the representative strain DN316(T) represents a novel species. Phenotypic and biochemical characterization of the isolates and insertion sequence-PCR fingerprinting patterns showed several distinctive features that differentiated them from closely related species.

Although activity of certain mobile elements is likely a contributing factor for this kind of intra-specific variations in maize, it is conceivable that other mechanisms might be involved. Here, we report that de novo genetic variation occurred instantaneously in a pair of reciprocal maize F(1) hybrids between inbred lines JAU8 and JAUM. Because expected genetic stability was observed in two other pairs of reciprocal hybrids in which each of these two lines was used as a crossing parent, we consider that the genomic instability in the JAU8/JAUM hybrids is due to specific incompatibilities between the two lines upon hybridization. Pairwise sequence analysis revealed the nature of the genetic changes as predominantly nucleotide substitutions with occasional small indels. At least some of the hybridization-induced genetic variations are likely associated with alteration in cytosine methylation.

{"Abstract": ["Shigella spp. are the causative agent of shigellosis with Shigella flexneri serotype 2a being the most prevalent in developing countries. Epidemiological surveillance in China found that a new serotype of S. flexneri appeared in 2001 and replaced serotype 2a in 2003 as the most prevalent serotype in Henan Province. The new serotype also became the dominant serotype in 7 of the 10 other provinces under surveillance in China by 2007. The serotype was identified as a variant of serotype X. It differs from serotype X by agglutination to the monovalent anti-IV type antiserum and the group antigen-specific monoclonal antibody MASF IV-I. Genome sequencing of a serotype X variant isolate, 2002017, showed that it acquired a Shigella serotype conversion island, also as an SfX bacteriophage, containing gtr genes for type X-specific glucosylation. Multilocus sequence typing of 15 genes from 37 serotype X variant isolates and 69 isolates of eight other serotypes, 1a, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5b, X, and Y, found that all belong to a new sequence type (ST), ST91. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed 154 pulse types with 655 S. flexneri isolates analyzed and identified 57 serotype switching events. The data suggest that S. flexneri epidemics in China have been caused by a single epidemic clone, ST91, with frequent serotype switching to evade infection-induced immunity to serotypes to which the population was exposed previously. The clone has also acquired resistance to multiple antibiotics.

{"Abstract": ["A novel polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-degrading bacterium, strain H25T, which was isolated from deep-sea water of the Indian Ocean, was studied phenotypically, genotypically and phylogenetically. Strain H25T can utilize several PAHs including phenanthrene and fluoranthene as sole carbon sources. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain H25T showed the highest similarity with that of Novosphingobium naphthalenivorans TUT562T (96.3%), and showed lower similarities (92.1-96.0%) with other members of the genus Novosphingobium. The major fatty acids of strain H25T were C14:0 2-OH (3.2%), C16:0 (13.6%), C16:1omega7c (5.2%), C18:0 (13.4%) and C18:1omega7c (57.0%), which accounted for 92.3% of the total fatty acids. It had ubiquinone 10 as the major respiratory quinone and spermidine as the major polyamine. All these characteristics were consistent with those of recognized Novosphingobium species. Results of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments and BOX-PCR fingerprint comparisons also indicate that strain H25T represents a novel Novosphingobium species, for which the name Novosphingobium indicum sp. nov. is proposed.

The analysis of sequence variation in the nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS) has recently become an effective method for identification of medicinal herbs. In the present study, we found that nrDNA ITS sequences differ significantly between L. japonica and the 4 tested adulterant species.

However, it has been unclear whether such effects are reflected in the structure of methanogenic archaeal populations. In the present study, molecular analyses including cloning and sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting of archaeal 16S rRNA genes were used to characterize the methanogenic archaeal assemblages and to identify the effect of environmental variables including rice cultivar and N fertilizer on archaeal community compositions in a Chinese paddy field soil. The correlation between methanogenic archaeal composition and environmental variables was explored by correspondence analysis. The results showed that the spatial or niche factor (rice roots versus rhizosphere, surface, and the deeper layer soils) had the greatest influence on the archaeal community composition. There was an obvious enrichment or selection of hydrogenotrophic as opposed to acetoclastic methanogens by rice roots. The archaeal community also changed, though slightly, between the rhizosphere and bulk soils and between the surface soil and the deeper layer soil.

Screening 268 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers which cover the entire genome of Chinese cabbage was performed with bulked segregant analysis (BSA). On the basis of linkage analysis, the Ms gene was located on linkage group R07. In addition, through the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and the sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) techniques combining BSA, two SCAR markers which were converted from corresponding AFLP markers flanked the Ms gene.

Therefore, the diversity of this bacterium is important in its clinical manifestations. Our aim has been to evaluate the genetic diversity of 40 H. pylori clinical isolates from four different parts of China. The methods of multi-locus sequence typing and vacA allele genotyping were used to assess their genetic diversity. To discriminate MLST, the vacA genotype method was used to identify strains. Patients from the northern, eastern, southern, and southwestern parts of China were recruited randomly from the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, respectively. Most of the sequence types are new and have never been reported in the database of the H. pylori multi-locus sequence typing system. The most prevalent vacA genotype in patients was s1a/m2 (80.0%), followed by s1b/m2 (17.5%). In contrast, the s1a/m1 genotype was scarcely represented (2.5%). The vacA genotype varied for each ST. These results showed that the MLST method offers high resolution of the H. pylori isolates in China when compared to vacA genotyping. The vacA allelic s1a has been correlated with the peptic ulcer.

{"Abstract": ["This study investigated the microbiological characteristics of 100 clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans species complex, including serotypes, mating types, molecular types, antifungal susceptibility and virulence. The isolates were collected at National Taiwan University Hospital from 1999 to 2004. Eight isolates of C. neoformans from pigeon droppings were also evaluated. Among these isolates, 99 were C. neoformans var. grubii serotype A and one was C. neoformans var. gattii serotype B. All of these isolates were alpha mating types. PCR fingerprinting, generated by primers M13 and (GACA)(4), and URA5 gene restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that C. neoformans var. grubii isolates belonged to the VNI (98 isolates) and the VNII (one isolate) types, and the single C. neoformans var. gattii was VGI type. The similar profiles of clinical and environmental isolates suggest that patients might acquire these yeasts from the environment. The MIC(90) for fluconazole, itraconazole, 5-flucytosine, voriconazole and amphotericin B against all C. neoformans isolates were 8, 0.5, 4, 0.125 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. All clinical isolates produced urease, phospholipase, capsule and melanin, but these activities varied with individual isolates. Analysis of six clinical and two environmental isolates with various levels of phospholipase activity indicated a correlation between phospholipase activity and the ability to adhere to the lung epithelial cell line, A549. The extent of cell damage, as indicated by lactate dehydrogenase release, also paralleled the phospholipase activity of these isolates.

{"Abstract": ["Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important wheat diseases worldwide in areas with cool or maritime climates. Wild emmer (Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides) is an important potential donor of disease resistances and other traits for common wheat improvement. A powdery mildew resistance gene was transferred from wild emmer accession G-303-1M to susceptible common wheat by crossing and backcrossing, resulting in inbred line P63 (Yanda1817/G-303-1 M//3*Jing411, BC(2)F(6)). Genetic analysis of an F(2) population and the F(2:3) families developed from a cross of P63 and a susceptible common wheat line Xuezao showed that the powdery mildew resistance in P63 was controlled by a single recessive gene. Molecular markers and bulked segregant analysis were used to characterize and map the powdery mildew resistance gene. Nine genomic SSR markers (Xbarc7, Xbarc55, Xgwm148, Xgwm257, Xwmc35, Xwmc154, Xwmc257, Xwmc382, Xwmc477), five AFLP-derived SCAR markers (XcauG3, XcauG6, XcauG10, XcauG20, XcauG22), three EST-STS markers (BQ160080, BQ160588, BF146221) and one RFLP-derived STS marker (Xcau516) were linked to the resistance gene, designated pm42, in P63. pm42 was physically mapped on chromosome 2BS bin 0.75-0.84 using Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic, ditelosomic and deletion lines, and was estimated to be more than 30 cM proximal to Xcau516, a RFLP-derived STS marker that co-segregated with the wild emmer-derived Pm26 which should be physically located in 2BS distal bin 0.84-1.00. pm42 was highly effective against 18 of 21 differential Chinese isolates of B. graminis f. sp. tritici.

{"Abstract": ["To investigate the diversity of root endophytes in Rhododendron fortunei, fungal strains were isolated from the hair roots of plants from four habitats in subtropical forests of China. In total, 220 slow-growing fungal isolates were isolated from the hair roots of R. fortunei. The isolates were initially grouped into 17 types based on the results of internal transcribed spacer-restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS-RFLP) analysis. ITS sequences were obtained for representative isolates from each RFLP type and compared phylogenetically with known sequences of ericoid mycorrhizal endophytes and selected ascomycetes or basidiomycetes. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the ITS sequences in GenBank, 15 RFLP types were confirmed as ascomycetes, and two as basidiomycetes; nine of these were shown to be ericoid mycorrhizal endophytes in experimental cultures. The only common endophytes of R. fortunei were identified as Oidiodendron maius at four sites, although the isolation frequency (3-65%) differed sharply according to habitat. Phialocephala fortinii strains were isolated most abundantly from two habitats which related to the more acidic soil and pine mixed forests. A number of less common mycorrhizal RFLP types were isolated from R. fortunei at three, two, or one of the sites. Most of these appeared to have strong affinities for some unidentified root endophytes from Ericaceae hosts in Australian forests.

{"Abstract": ["This study attempted to assess whether conspecific or congeneric sponges around San Juan Island, Washington, harbor specific bacterial communities. We used a combination of culture-independent DNA fingerprinting techniques (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [DGGE]) and culture-dependent approaches. The results indicated that the bacterial communities in the water column consisted of more diverse bacterial ribotypes than and were drastically different from those associated with the sponges. High levels of similarity in sponge-associated bacterial communities were found only in Myxilla incrustans and Haliclona rufescens, while the bacterial communities in Halichondria panicea varied substantially among sites. Certain terminal restriction fragments or DGGE bands were consistently obtained for different individuals of M. incrustans and H. rufescens collected from different sites, suggesting that there are stable or even specific associations of certain bacteria in these two sponges. However, no specific bacterial associations were found for H. panicea or for any one sponge genus. Sequencing of nine DGGE bands resulted in recovery of seven sequences that best matched the sequences of uncultured Proteobacteria. Three of these sequences fell into the sponge-specific sequence clusters previously suggested. An uncultured alphaproteobacterium and a culturable Bacillus sp. were found exclusively in all M. incrustans sponges, while an uncultured gammaproteobacterium was unique to H. rufescens. In contrast, the cultivation approach indicated that sponges contained a large proportion of Firmicutes, especially Bacillus, and revealed large variations in the culturable bacterial communities associated with congeneric and conspecific sponges.

Here we carried out a study of the evolution of protein molecules by investigating homologous relationships among residue segments.

Based on the data of a large number of non-redundant proteins, the universe of non-membrane polypeptide was analyzed by considering both residue mutations and structural conservation. By connecting homologous segments with edges, we obtained a homologous relationship network of the whole universe of short residue segments, which we named the graph of polypeptide relationships (GPR). Since the network is extremely complicated for topological transitions, to obtain an in-depth understanding, only subgraphs composed of vital nodes of the GPR were analyzed. Such analysis of vital subgraphs of the GPR revealed a donut-shaped fingerprint. Utilization of this topological feature revealed the switch sites (where the beginning of exposure of previously hidden \"hot spots\" of fibril-forming happens, in consequence a further opportunity for protein aggregation is provided; 188-202) of the conformational conversion of the normal alpha-helix-rich prion protein PrP(C) to the beta-sheet-rich PrP(Sc) that is thought to be responsible for a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.

{"Abstract": ["This is the first study to investigate vertical transmission of Chlamydia trachomatis in Chongqing China. For this study, 300 cervical swab samples from pregnant women and 305 nasopharygeal swab samples from their babies (605 specimens) were collected for nest polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) of the ompl gene, which encodes the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) and typed C. trachomatis using Cleavase fragment-length polymorphism (CFLP) labeled with digoxin. From these samples, 11% (33/300) of pregnant women samples were successfully amplified. The vertical transmission rate of C. trachomatis from mother to baby was 24% (8/33). The vertical transmission rates were 66.7% (6/9) for mothers with vaginal delivery and 8.3% (2/24) for those with cesarean section. The incidence of premature membrane rupture among C. trachomatis-positive pregnant women was 30.3% (10/33), which was greater than among those who were C. trachomatis-negative (13.5%, 36/267; chi(2) = 4.2; p < 0.05). Four genotypes including type E (3 pairs), type F (2 pairs), type H (2 pairs), and type D (1 pair) were observed by CFLP assay labeled with digoxin and confirmed by DNA sequencing in the 16 C. trachomatis-positive samples from eight pregnant women and their eight infants.

In many reports, investigations of microbial diversity from environmental samples were based on the agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) patterns of ERIC-PCR amplified products. This is not a sound practice, since bands with identical positions can contain different sequences; thus, this practice could possibly exaggerate the similarities or diversities among samples. To mitigate this issue, we employed a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) strategy to explore DNA bands with the same size, between ERIC-PCR profiles of samples. DPS software was used with Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') to analyze ERIC-PCR fingerprint profiles. H' revealed that the microbial community diversity at DGGE was higher than with AGE.

{"Abstract": ["In comparison to herbaceous plants, studies of cold responsive genes and cold signaling in woody perennials are limited. Since most woody plants have evolved freezing tolerance (FT) in winter, together with similar lignified structures and winter adaptive mechanisms, it is more likely to find cold resistant genes in woody plants growing in temperate and arctic regions. In this study, Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, an evergreen, broadleaf and leguminous shrub was selected as a model to study cold tolerance in woody plants. Thirteen cold up-regulated cDNAs (including eight full-length cDNAs and five partial cDNAs) were cloned from A. mongolicus. One of these genes, AmEBP1, confers enhanced cold tolerance to E. coli and obvious increased freezing survival to Arabidopsis. In transgenic Arabidopsis expressing AmEBP1, transcript levels of some downstream genes in cold signaling exhibit increased accumulation upon cold treatment. Together with structural information, sub-cellular location, and promoter analysis data, it is suggested that AmEBP1 enhances plants cold tolerance by accelerating ribosome biogenesis and the concomitant translation of cold induced transcription factors and downstream protective proteins under cold stress."], "Citation": ["Plant Mol Biol. 2009 Mar;69(5):529-39. doi: 10.1007/s11103-008-9434-1.

{"Abstract": ["To identify the genotype and subtype distributions of Cryptosporidium oocysts in domestic wastewater in Shanghai, China, and to facilitate the characterization of the endemic transmission of cryptosporidiosis, raw domestic wastewater samples were collected from four wastewater treatment plants in Shanghai, China, from December 2006 to April 2007. Genotypes of Cryptosporidium species were detected based on PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analyses of the small-subunit rRNA gene. Samples that contained Cryptosporidium hominis were further subtyped by DNA sequencing of the 60-kDa glycoprotein gene. Among a total of 90 samples analyzed, 63 were PCR positive, 10 of which had mixed genotypes. Fifty-nine (93.7%) of the PCR-positive samples had C. hominis, and 7 (11.1%) had C. meleagridis. The other seven Cryptosporidium species/genotypes identified included C. baileyi, C. parvum, C. suis, C. muris, rat genotype, avian genotype III, and a novel genotype. Forty-seven of the 59 C. hominis-positive samples were successfully subtyped, with 29 having subtype family Ib and the remaining belonging to subtype families Ia, Id, Ie, and If. The three Ib subtypes identified, IbA19G2, IbA20G2, and IbA21G2, were very different from the two common Ib subtypes (IbA9G3 and IbA10G2) found in other areas of the world. Likewise, the Ie subtype IeA12G3T3 was also different from the common IeA11G3T3 subtype.

{"Abstract": ["The genus Croomia (Stemonaceae) comprises three herbaceous perennial species that are distributed in temperate-deciduous forests in Southeastern North America (C.pauciflora) and East Asia (C. japonica, C. heterosepala). The two Asian species have abutting ranges in South Japan, but C. japonica also occurs disjunctively on the adjacent Asiatic mainland in East China. In our phylogenetic analysis of Croomia, based on chloroplast (cp) DNA sequence variation of the trnL-F region, and rooted with Stemona spp., the two Asian species are identified as sister that likely diverged in the Mid-to-Late Pleistocene (0.84-0.13 mya), whereas the divergence of C. pauciflora dates back to the Late Plio-/Pleistocene (<2.6 mya). Phylogeographical analysis of the two East Asian species detected seven cpDNA (trnL-F) haplotypes across 16 populations surveyed, and all of those were fixed for a particular cpDNA haplotype (H(E)=0.0, G(ST)=1). A survey of inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) markers also detected remarkably low levels of within-population diversity (C. japonica: H(E)=0.085; C. heterosepala: H(E)=0.125), and high levels of inter-population differentiation (C. japonica: Phi(ST)=0.736; C. heterosepala: Phi(ST)=0.550), at least partly due to pronounced regional genetic substructure within both species. Non-overlapping distributions of cpDNA haplotypes and strong genetic (cpDNA/ISSR) differentiation among populations and/or regions accord with findings of a nested clade analysis, which inferred allopatric fragmentation as the major process influencing the spatial haplotype distribution of the two species. Based on mismatch distribution analysis and neutrality tests, we do not find evidence of population expansion in both species. Overall, we conclude that components of temperate-deciduous forest types in South Japan and East China are particularly sensitive to range fragmentation, isolation, and enhanced (incipient) species formation through climate-induced expansions of other forest types over glacial and interglacial periods of the (Late) Quaternary."], "Citation": ["Mol Phylogenet Evol. 2008 Dec;49(3):702-14. doi: 10.1016/j.ympev.2008.09.012.

Characterisation included mating type, virulence, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype and DNA fingerprinting patterns based on simple sequence repeats (SSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). All isolates had the A1 mating type, mtDNA haplotype IIa and an identical SSR genotype (designated as SG-01-01) that differed from SSR genotypes found in the reference isolates, including those representing the 'old' US-1 lineage that dominated the P. infestans population worldwide prior to 1980. In contrast, the virulence spectra were highly variable and virulence to all resistance genes present in the standard differential set (R1 to R11) was found. AFLP analysis revealed some diversity; eight different AFLP genotypes were found that could be grouped into two major clusters. This study shows that there is very little genotypic diversity in the P. infestans population in Northern China.

{"Abstract": ["cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) is a powerful transcript-profiling tool widely used in diverse plant species. When applied to a new biological system, however, existing protocols usually require substantial modifications. Furthermore, the usage of radioactive isotope in typical protocols excludes their application in many labs. Latex, as the cytoplasm of rubber-producing cells sees a critical role in elucidating rubber biosynthesis and its regulation in rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). This paper describes a detailed step-by-step silver-staining cDNA-AFLP procedure, which is suitable to latex transcript profiling analysis. Theoretical analysis revealed that with the combination of two restriction enzyme pairs (ApoI/MseI and TaqI/MseI), approximately 94% of latex whole transcriptome could be visualized. After varying multiple parameters, including the amounts of primary and secondary template usage, pre-amplification cycle number and gel development, we obtained a high-quality silver-staining fingerprint. In the ApoI/MseI system, an average of 88.6 discernable bands (100-1,000 bp) was produced for each selective primer pair, and 97.2 bands for another system (TaqI/MseI).

{"Abstract": ["In plant tissue culture, developmental disturbance and mutagenic factors are involved in channeling an individual totipotent cell to an intact plant. Comparing a pair of sorghum reciprocal F(1) hybrids with their parental pure lines revealed a dramatic difference in the occurrence of both genetic and DNA methylation alterations in the respective regenerated plants. In contrast to those of the pure lines, regenerated plants of hybrids exhibit significantly enhanced genetic and epigenetic stability. The genetic changes detected by amplified fragment length polymorphism and the DNA methylation alterations detected by methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism are intimately correlated with each other, suggesting a common mechanism underlying both kinds of instabilities. Markedly altered transcription of genes encoding four putative sorghum DNA methyltransferases and two 5-methylcytosine glycosylases with nucleotide sequences orthologous to Arabidopsis counterparts was induced by tissue culture. The steady-state transcript levels of these genes were negatively correlated with genetic and methylation alterations. A salient observation is that tissue culture-induced transcription of genes encoding DNA methyltransferases and 5-methylcytosine glycosylases in calli and/or regenerated plants of the hybrids was remarkably coordinated, but is largely uncoordinated and stochastically altered in calli and/or regenerated plants of the pure lines. We suggest that the uncoordinated regulation of expression of DNA methyltransferases and 5-methylcytosine glycosylases is a major cause of the high incidence of genetic and DNA methylation alterations in cultures of pure lines, but coordinated up-regulated expression of these enzymes in cultures of the F(1) hybrids fortified their genetic and epigenetic stability."], "Citation": ["Plant J. 2009 Feb;57(4):666-79. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03719.x.

{"Abstract": ["To effectively conserve sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.) germplasm on two islands at the estuary of the Yangtze River in China, we estimated genetic variation and relationships of the known parental trees and their proposed descendents (young trees) using the fingerprints of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Results based on RAPD analyses showed considerable genetic diversity in the parental populations (H(e)=0.202). The overall populations including the parental and young trees showed slightly higher genetic diversity (H(e)=0.298) than the parents, with about 10% variation between populations. An unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean analysis dendrogram based on cluster analysis of the Jaccard similarity among individuals demonstrated a more complicated relationship of the parental and young trees from the two islands, although the young trees showed a clear association with parental trees.

{"Abstract": ["To control the genetic quality during the whole process of tissue culture of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant, Saussurea involucrate Kar. et Kir., DNA polymorphisms and genetic variations were investigated using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. The genetic stability/variation in tissue-cultured products, including three calli, three adventitious shoots, regenerated plantlets and 2 year-old regenerated plantlets cultivated in the planting base in Tianshan Mountain, were assessed compared with 1 year-old and 2 year-old seedlings cultivated in the same planting base using aseptic seedlings as reference. Apparent genetic variation was detected in the 11 type of plant materials. The percentages of polymorphic bands in the RAPD and ISSR analysis were, respectively, 35% and 33%. Cluster analysis indicated that the genetic similarity values calculated on the basis of RAPD and ISSR data among the 11 type of plant materials were respectively ranged from 0.823 to 0.995 with a mean of 0.878 and 0.825 to 0.974 with a mean of 0.885, which classified the samples into three groups. The similarity coefficient also revealed that differences among three calli were not remarkable by both RAPD and ISSR analysis, and only chemical components and growth properties needed consideration in the screening of callus used for the next redifferentiation studies.

All the HII individuals showed morphological deformities and died before first feeding. The chromosome analysis showed that HI individuals had the same chromosome number as parents. However, two chromosomes were missing in HII offspring indicating that the latter were aneuploids. Genomic inheritance from the parents to F(1) progeny was also examined by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses, and the results showed differences between reciprocal hybrids. Almost all AFLP bands (97.71%) observed in parents were passed on to HI individuals. In contrast, only 86.64% of the AFLP bands from parents were scored in HII individuals. Frequency of lost parental bands was thus significantly higher in HII than that in HI and intraspecific crosses, which was probably associated with chromosomal elimination. In addition, higher segregation distortions were found in hybrids than in controls, although these differences were not significant.

{"Abstract": ["It is commonly known that tigers (Panthera tigris) groom themselves by licking their coats, which leads to an abundance of hairs in their feces. These hairs are designated specially as \"fecal hairs\". In our study, in order to explore fecal hairs potential as a DNA source for genetic analysis, 55 fecal hair samples were collected from 23 captive South China tigers (P. t. amoyensis). According to the amplification of mitochondrial primers loop F and loop R, DNA quality of noninvasive samples were grouped into three grades: grade I-the highest-quality DNA, grade II--high-quality DNA, and grade III--poor-quality DNA. No failed amplifications on microsatellite primers and only 0.27% genotyping errors occurred with grade I fecal hair DNA, as compared with 9.4% failed amplifications on microsatellite primers and 9.5% genotyping errors with grade II fecal hair DNA. It was found that 25.45% of fecal hair DNA was grade I and 65.45 and 10.00% of fecal hair DNA were grades II and III, respectively, as compared with 4.35% grade I fecal DNA and 34.78 and 60.87% grades II and III fecal DNA, respectively. Thus, higher-quality DNA can be extracted from fecal hairs than feces. In addition, DNA could be extracted from hair shafts of tigers and a minimum of 2000 hair shafts were required for visible DNA bands on a 1% agarose gel.

First, three partial new-type B. napus lines were compared with their original parents. One new line contained the exotic genomic components from B. rapa, and the other two new lines were obtained by the introgression of genomic components from B. rapa and B. carinata. The experimental results showed that the introgression of A(r) and C(c) genome components from B. rapa and B. carinata led to considerable differences in the gene expression profiles of the partial new-type lines when compared with their parents. Secondly, the gene expression profiles of nine cross-combinations between three partial new-type lines and three B. napus cultivars were compared. Twenty transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) associated with intersubgenomic heterosis were randomly selected and converted into PCR-based molecular markers.

At high sulfate and nitrate loading rates, the heterotrophic denitrifiers overcompete autotrophic denitrifiers to reduce SRB activities.

A large-scale cultivation program was initiated and cultivated populations rapidly recovered the loss in individual plant numbers, but wild populations remained small as a consequence of cutting. In this study, the levels of genetic variation and genetic structure of seven wild populations and five domestic populations of M. officinalis subsp. biloba were estimated employing an AFLP methodology. The plant exhibited a relatively high level of intra-population genetic diversity (h = 0.208 and H(j) = 0.268). The cultivated populations maintained approximately 95% of the variation exhibited in wild populations, indicating a slight genetic bottleneck in the cultivated populations. The analysis of genetic differentiation revealed that most of the AFLP diversity resided within populations both for the wild group (78.22%) and the cultivated group (85.92%). Genetic differentiation among populations in the wild group was significant (F(ST) = 0.1092, P < 0.005), suggesting wild population level genetic structure.

The male sterility of 9012AB is controlled by two recessive genes (designated Bnms3 and Bnms4) interacting with one recessive epistatic suppressor gene (esp). Previous study has identified seven AFLP markers, six of which were co-segregated with the Bnms3 gene in a small population (Ke et al. in Plant Breed 124:367-370, 2005). By cloning these AFLP markers and their flanking sequences, five of the six co-segregated markers were successfully converted into sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. For fine mapping of the Bnms3 gene, these SCAR markers were analyzed in a NIL population of 4,136 individuals. The Bnms3 gene was then genetically mapped to a region of 0.56 cM, with 0.15 cM from marker SEP8 and 0.41 from marker SEP4, respectively. BLAST analysis with these SCAR marker sequences identified a collinear genomic region in Arabidopsis chromosome 5, from which two specific PCR markers further narrowed the Bnms3 locus from an interval of 0.56 to 0.14 cM.

A comparative analysis of the phylogenetic Group 1 and 2 was undertaken. Restriction fragment length polymorphism results allowed us to separate the 35 Acidithiobacillus strains into 15 different genotypes. An integrated phenotypic and genotypic analysis indicated that the distribution of A. ferrooxidans strains among the physiological groups were in agreement with their distribution among the genomic groups, and that no clear correlation was found between the genetic polymorphism of the Acidithiobacillus spp. strains and either the geographic location or type of habitats from which the strains were isolated.

{"Abstract": ["Transposable elements have been utilized as mutagens to create mutant libraries for functional genomics. Isolation of genomic segments flanking the insertion Mutator (Mu) is a key step in insertion mutagenesis studies. Herein, we adopted a modified AFLP method to identify and isolate Mu-flanking fragments from maize. The method consists of the following steps: 1) double-digestion of genomic DNA with Bgl II/Msp I and ligation of digested fragments to the Bgl II- and Msp I-adaptors; 2) enrichment of a subset of Bgl II/Msp I fragments followed by selective amplification of the Mu-flanking fragments; 3) simultaneous display of AFLP bands derived from the flanking regions for both insert and native Mu transposons; 4) identification and isolation of AFLP bands resulting from Mu insertions by comparing the banding profiles between Mu-induced mutants and their parental lines; and 5) confirmation of flanking fragments related to these Mu insertions. Using this approach, we have isolated flanking fragment(s) resulting from Mu insertion for every Mu-induced mutant, and one such fragment, M196-FF, is found to contain a partial sequence of the DNA topoisomerase I gene Top1.

B. rapa ssp. chinensis). Genetic analysis revealed that bcms was controlled by a single recessive mutation locus. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling was performed on the flower buds of both the bcms mutant and the wild-type from which it originated, and profiling analysis indicated that there were numerous changes in gene expression attributable to the gene mutation. This mutation resulted in down-regulation of a variety of genes and up-regulated expression of a few other genes. A total of 51 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were isolated: 32 specifically and 12 predominantly accumulated in wild-type flower buds, and two specifically and five predominantly accumulated in bcms flower buds. Sequence analysis showed that some of these TDFs share significant similarities with genes involved in different aspects of cellular development, such as signal transduction, cell wall biosynthesis and regulation. Most other TDFs showed no or very poor sequence similarities to entries in any database and might represent new candidate proteins involved in pollen development. Furthermore, spatial and temporal expression pattern analysis of 20 genes derived from cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism in different tissues of both the bcms and wild-type plants revealed their complex and dynamic expression patterns.

Diverse bacteria such as alpha-, gamma-, delta-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were cultured, some of which were previously uncultivable bacteria, potential novel strains with less than 95% similarity to their closest relatives and sponge symbionts growing only in the medium with the addition of sponge extract. According to 16S rDNA BLAST analysis, most of the bacteria were cultured from sponge for the first time, although similar phyla of bacteria have been previously recognized. The selective pressure of sponge extract on the cultured bacterial species was suggested, although the effect of sponge extract on bacterial community in high nutrient medium is not significant. Although alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria appeared to form the majority of the dominant cultivable bacterial communities of the four sponges, the composition of the cultivable bacterial community in the mixed culture was different, depending on the medium and sponge species. Greater bacterial diversity was observed in media C and CS for Stelletta tenuis, in media F and FS for Halichondria rugosa and Craniella australiensis. S. tenuis was found to have the highest cultivable bacterial diversity including alpha-, gamma-, delta-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, followed by sponge Dysidea avara without delta-Proteobacteria, sponge Halichondria rugosa with only alpha-, gamma-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and sponge C. australiensis with only alpha-, gamma-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes.

{"Abstract": ["A molecular method based on PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA sequences was designed to rapidly identify fungal species, with members of the genus Pleurotus as an example. Based on the results of phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences from Pleurotus, a PCR-RFLP endonuclease autoscreening (PRE Auto) program was developed to screen restriction endonucleases for discriminating multiple sequences from different species. The PRE Auto program analyzes the endonuclease recognition sites and calculates the sizes of the fragments in the sequences that are imported into the program in groups according to species recognition. Every restriction endonuclease is scored through the calculation of the average coefficient for the sequence groups and the average coefficient for the sequences within a group, and then virtual electrophoresis maps for the selected restriction enzymes, based on the results of the scoring system, are displayed for the rapid determination of the candidate endonucleases. A total of 85 haplotypes representing 151 ITS sequences were used for the analysis, and 2,992 restriction endonucleases were screened to find the candidates for the identification of species. This method was verified by an experiment with 28 samples representing 12 species of Pleurotus. The results of the digestion by the restriction enzymes showed the same patterns of DNA fragments anticipated by the PRE Auto program, apart from those for four misidentified samples.

In this study, we report a novel male sterility gene, ms91(t), in a spontaneous mutant line (SH38) from a Chinese rice cultivar (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica 'Jijing14'). The sterility of SH38 was studied by examining its progenies derived from crosses with 6 japonica cultivars.

To investigate the level of genetic variation in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causative agent of rice bacterial blight disease, three DNA marker systems, including (i) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the avrBs3/PthA family genes (avrXa27), (ii) RFLP of insertion (IS) elements and (iii) random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, were used to detect polymorphism among 32 Xoo strains that differed in their virulence patterns. All these strains contained multiple avrXa27 homologs that were variable in copy number and genomic location. RFLP of six IS elements revealed that these mobile sequences were abundant in Xoo genomes, with 150 of the total of 165 discernable markers being variable. Thirty-eight decamer primers of RAPD amplified a total of 691 bands, with 100% of them being variable. In addition, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of data from RFLP analysis of IS elements and from RAPD analysis showed that most of the genetic variation residues were within Xoo populations, rather than between populations. Although all three DNA marker systems supported that substantial variation was maintained in Xoo genomes, Mantel tests did not identify significant correlation between the similarity coefficients calculated from them.

Nine selected SSR primer pairs amplified a total of 55 alleles from these varieties, and high genetic diversity (0.706) was found, although it was not evenly distributed across the regions. Marked genetic variation was detected within the traditional varieties. A UPGMA dendrogram based on SSR polymorphism indicated a great variation among the rice varieties, with coefficients ranging between 0.229 and 1.000. The formation of the rice diversity pattern in Yunnan is associated with natural conditions and especially with diverse cultural demands and farming styles. Strategic conservation of rice germplasm in Yunnan is important, and this could be implemented by collecting varieties across geographic regions with sufficient individuals within the same varieties.

Although several BW-resistant peanut germplasm accessions have been identified, the genetic diversity among these has not been properly investigated, which has impeded efficient utilization. In this study, the genetic relationships of 31 peanut genotypes with various levels of resistance to BW were assessed based on SSR and AFLP analyses. Twenty-nine of 78 SSR primers and 32 of 126 AFLP primer combinations employed in this study were polymorphic amongst the peanut genotypes tested.

Transplantation of human gut microbiota into surrogate hosts can significantly facilitate the research of human gut ecology, metabolism and immunity but rodents-based model provides results with low relevance to humans. A new human flora-associated (HFA) piglet model was hereby established taking advantage of the high similarity between pigs and humans with respect to the anatomy, physiology and metabolism of the digestive system. Piglets were delivered via cesarean section into a SPF-level barrier system and were inoculated orally with a whole fecal suspension from one healthy 10-year-old boy. The establishment and composition of the intestinal microbiota of the HFA piglets were analyzed and compared with that of the human donor using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence-PCR fingerprinting-based community DNA hybridization, group-specific PCR-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR. Molecular profiling demonstrated that transplantation of gut microbiota from a human to germfree piglets produced a donor-like microbial community with minimal individual variation. And the microbial succession with aging of those ex-germfree piglets was also similar to that observed in humans.

Comparative sequence analysis of an approximately 300 bp differential fragment amplified by primer combination E11M11 revealed 80%-84% similarity to the corresponding part of an a-tubulin gene of other species. The complete cDNA sequence of this a-tubulin was cloned by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique; its full length is 1537 bp and contains an open reading frame of 450 amino acid residues with two N-glycosylation sites and four protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. The deduced amino acid sequences did show significant homology to the a-tubulin from other plants that has been reported to be a pollen-specific protein and could be correlated with plant cytoplasm-nucleus-interacted male sterility. We named this complete cDNA Tua1. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence data of Tua1 have been recorded in the GenBank sequence database. This Tua1 gene was cloned into the pET-32a expression system and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21trxB(DE3). The molecular weight of expressed protein was deduced to be approximately 49 kDa.

The RFLP fingerprinting of selected strains by HhaI-digestion of the 16S rRNA genes resulted in 11 different patterns. The HhaI-RFLP analysis gave good resolution for the identification of the actinobacteria isolates at the genus level. A phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolates belonged to seven genera of culturable actinobacteria including Actinoalloteichus, Micromonospora, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis, Pseudonocardia, Rhodococcus, and Streptomyces.

After 14 successive inoculations, a high-virulence progeny, termed PS2-vir, was obtained and demonstrated to exhibit lower oospore production. DNA fingerprinting revealed no large-scale DNA differences in PS2 and PS2-vir. A suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) approach was developed to investigate differences in gene expression between PS2 and PS2-vir in the early stages of soybean infection. Of the 323 sequences chosen for examination, 74 putative unigenes were identified that exhibit high expression in PS2-vir. These sequences are predicted to encode proteins involved in energy production, protein biosynthesis, cell signaling, cell-wall biogenesis, and transcription regulation. Ten clones were selected for temporal expression analysis using RT-PCR based on the results of the dot-blot screens.

The structure of BAA was evidently changed according to the analysis of total organic carbon removal of BAA (about 50%) and the UV-VIS spectra changes during the biodegradation. Bioaugmented systems exhibited stronger abilities degrading BAA than the non-bioaugmented control ones. And microbial community dynamics of augmented systems was revealed by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), a modern DNA fingerprint technique.

{"Abstract": ["Three different DNA fingerprinting techniques, the mobile genetic element (MGE)-PCR, simple sequence repeat (SSR)-PCR and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, were used to define a large set of genetic markers to study genetic similarity within and among Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma equiperdum and Trypanosoma evansi strains (n=18) from China, Africa and South America and to investigate their genetic relationships. Using the three fingerprinting techniques, >890 bands (ranging in size from 0.2 to 2kb) were defined for all 18 strains of Trypanosoma. Within each of the strains, 39-59 bands were defined. The similarity coefficients between strains ranged from approximately 41 to 94%, with a mean of 65%. There was more genetic similarity among strains within T. evansi (mean of approximately 79%) compared with T. equiperdum ( approximately 65%) and T. brucei ( approximately 59%). The similarity coefficient data were used to construct the dendrogram, which revealed that (irrespective of species) the majority of strains from China and South America grouped together to the exclusion of those from Africa. The exceptions were a T. brucei strain from Africa and a T. equiperdum strain of unknown origin. Hence, employing data sets generated using the three different fingerprinting methods, it was not possible to unequivocally distinguish among T. brucei, T. evansi and T. equiperdum, although there was a tendency for T. evansi strains to group together to the exclusion of T. brucei.

{"Abstract": ["Bacterial populations common to healthy human guts may play important roles in human health. A new strategy for discovering genomic sequences as markers for these bacteria was developed using Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC)-PCR fingerprinting. Structural features within microbial communities are compared with ERIC-PCR followed by DNA hybridization to identify genomic fragments shared by samples from healthy human individuals. ERIC-PCR profiles of fecal samples from 12 diseased or healthy human and piglet subjects demonstrated stable, unique banding patterns for each individual tested. Sequence homology of DNA fragments in bands of identical size was examined between samples by hybridization under high stringency conditions with DIG-labeled ERIC-PCR products derived from the fecal sample of one healthy child. Comparative analysis of the hybridization profiles with the original agarose fingerprints identified three predominant bands as signatures for populations associated with healthy human guts with sizes of 500, 800 and 1000 bp. Clone library profiling of the three bands produced 17 genome fragments, three of which showed high similarity only with regions of the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron genome, while the remainder were orphan sequences. Association of these sequences with healthy guts was validated by sequence-selective PCR experiments, which showed that a single fragment was present in all 32 healthy humans and 13 healthy piglets tested. Two fragments were present in the healthy human group and in 18 children with non-infectious diarrhea but not in eight children with infectious diarrhea.

The relatedness of 45 isolates of carbapenem-resistant Acb complex collected from a clinical setting was analysed by PFGE. The carbapenemases produced by these isolates were typed by IEF, a three-dimensional test, 2-mercaptopropanoic acid inhibition assay, PCR and DNA cloning and sequencing. Results showed that all 45 isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics including meropenem. The resistance rates to cefoperazone/sulbactam and ampicillin/sulbactam were 2.2 and 6.5%, respectively. About 71.7-78.3% of these isolates were intermediately resistant to cefepime, ceftazidime and cefotaxime. Forty-five isolates were classified into type A (98%) and B (2%) based on their PFGE patterns. Most of type A isolates were from the ICU. Type A was the dominant isolate, including subtypes A1 (22%), A2 (71%), A3 (2%) and A4 (2%). Only one isolate, from the haematology department, belonged to type B. Forty-three isolates (96%) were positive for carbapenemase. One isolate had two bands by IEF, the pIs of which were 6.64 and 7.17. The band with the pI of 6.64 was OXA-23. The other 42 isolates produced two bands with pIs of 6.40 and 7.01 which could not be inhibited by clavulanic acid, cloxacillin or 2-mercaptopropanoic acid.

However, a large population of Cervus nippon hortulorum and Cervus nippon nippon is raised in order to gain deer parts for Chinese traditional medicine. According to Chinese Wild Animal Conservation Law, hunting, capturing and trading of the wild sika deer are strictly banned, however, raising and trading of the domestic individual are permitted. Thus, it is very necessary to identify the subspecies of sika deer in China in forensic tests. In our study, we used mitochondrial DNA control region sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis to identify the subspecies of sika deer. Mitochondrial DNA control region sequences analysis revealed that two haplotypes came from the unknown samples. One is the same as the haplotype that came from the samples of wild population of C. n. kopschi. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the two haplotypes of unknown samples clustered with the haplotypes of C. n. kopschi, and had significant difference from the haplotypes of the other subspecies.

{"Abstract": ["Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) is a key enzyme involved in the synthesis of DNA precursors and thus, cell proliferation-dependent. Antibodies against TK1 have provided attractive tools for cancer diagnosis. Expression of TK1 in 158 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with 59 adenocarcinoma (AC) and 99 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was determined by anti-TK1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1E3 (AC, n=50; SCC, n=70). Parallel tumor sections were stained for Ki-67 (MIB-1), and TK1 expression was also investigated with anti-TK1 chicken IgY Ab (AC, n=9; SCC, n=29; normal lung tissues, n=10). In one AC and one SCC patient, gene profiling was done by cDNA array. Using the mAb 1E3, a significantly higher TK1 labeling index (LI) of AC patients was found (68%) compared to the LI of Ki-67 (36%). This difference was due to a significantly higher TK1 LI of tumor stage II and grade 2. Although no difference in the LI of TK1 and Ki-67 of SCC patients was found (54 vs. 53%), significantly higher TK1 LI of SCC patients of tumor grade 1 was found. Using the anti-TK1 IgY Ab, a higher TK1 LI of AC patients (78%) and SCC patients (66%) was found compared to staining with mAb 1E3 (68 vs. 54%), but it was not significantly different. Samples stained only for TK1 represented mostly tumor stages I and II and grades 1 and 2 of both AC and SCC.

{"Abstract": ["There is increasing evidence that many of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) databases published in the fields of forensic science and molecular anthropology are flawed. An a posteriori phylogenetic analysis of the sequences could help to eliminate most of the errors and thus greatly improve data quality. However, previously published caveats and recommendations along these lines were not yet picked up by all researchers. Here we call for stringent quality control of mtDNA data by haplogroup-directed database comparisons. We take some problematic databases of East Asian mtDNAs, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences and Forensic Science International, as examples to demonstrate the process of pinpointing obvious errors.

The tRNA-lacking ISR has no such functional sites that are important for yielding mature rRNA, which suggests that this type of rRNA operons might be degenerate.

{"Abstract": ["Vibrio cholerae O139, the second etiological serogroup of cholera, triggered the first outbreak of O139 cholera in China in 1993. To analyze the clone polymorphism of O139 isolates in China, 117 strains of V. cholerae O139, isolated from different areas in China between 1993 and 1999, were selected to characterize the phylogenetic relationships by molecular techniques. Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism in the conserved 16S rRNA gene revealed seven different ribotypes within the 117 strains. Among these strains, there were eight that lacked the cholera toxin gene (ctxAB), zot, and the repetitive sequence (RS); these eight strains belonged to three individual ribotypes. Our results suggested that V. cholerae O139 strains in China had clone diversity in phylogeny. The results of our hybridization patterns for CTX genetic elements (ctxAB, zot, and RS) showed that CTXPhi genomes in most V. cholerae O139 strains had two or more copies and had extensive restriction patterns even for the strains which belong to the same ribotype. For 22 (20.1%) strains, the copies of ctxAB were different from those of zot, suggesting that a ctxAB-negative CTXPhi genome may exist in O139 strains. This ctxAB-negative CTXPhi genome may coexist with the intact CTXPhi genome in a strain. In addition, the dendrogram for I-CeuI-generated pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns showed that V. cholerae serogroup O139 has a closer relationship with one strain of serogroup O22 than with the strains of serogroup O1.

The sharp separation of the organism from representatives of the genus Streptomyces was strengthened by the fact that its BOX-PCR and RFLP of 16S rDNA-ITS fingerprints differed from those of over 450 recognized Streptomyces species. The isolate also had a profile of phenotypic properties that readily distinguished it from the genotypically close type strains. It is evident from the combination of genotypic and phenotypic data that strain FXJ14(T) (=AS 4.1858(T)=JCM 12278(T)=LMG 22082(T)) should be classified as the type strain of a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces glauciniger sp. nov. is proposed."], "Citation": ["Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2004 Nov;54(Pt 6):2085-9."], "TitleName": ["Streptomyces glauciniger sp. nov., a novel mesophilic streptomycete isolated from soil in south China."], "AuthorsName": ["Huang Y", "1", "Li W", "Wang L", "Lanoot B", "Vancanneyt M", "Rodriguez C", "Liu Z", "Swings J", "Goodfellow M"], "pmid": ["15545439 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "State Key Laboratory of Microbial Resources, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China. huangy@im.ac.cn"], "email": ["huangy@im.ac.cn", "im.ac.cn"], "FullTextLink": ["http://ijs.microbiologyresearch.org/pubmed/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijs.0.63158-0"]},

{"Abstract": ["Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) plays an important role in crop heterosis exploitation. Determining one or more nuclear genes that can restore male fertility to CMS is essential for developing hybrid cultivars. Genetic and physical mapping is the standard technique required for isolating these restoration genes. By screening 2,250 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), we identified five new SSR markers that are closely linked to the Rf1 gene, a fertility restorer gene of cotton for CMS-D2. Based on our previous fine mapping of the Rf1 gene and assemblage of three published STS markers, we constructed a high-resolution genetic map of Rf1 containing 13 markers in a genetic distance of 0.9 cM. The 13 molecular markers were used to screen a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library from a restorer line 0-613-2R containing Rf1 gene, which yielded 50 single positive clones. There was an average of 3.8 clones ranging from 1 to 12 BAC clones per PCR marker. These 50 clones produced an average insert size of 120 kb (ranging between 80 and 225 kb). Thirty-five primer pairs were designed based on 38 sequences of BAC ends, and two new STS markers tightly linked to Rf1 gene have been tagged and integrated into this map. The physical map for the Rf1 gene was constructed by fingerprinting the positive clones digested with the HindIII enzyme. We were able to delimit the possible location of the Rf1 gene to a minimum of two BAC clones spanning an interval of approximately 100 kb between two clones designated 081-05K and 052-01N.

{"Abstract": ["In investigating criminal cases of poaching and smuggling involving tigers (Panthera tigris), the number of tiger individuals involved is critical for determining the penalty. Morphological methodologies do not often work because tiger parts do not possess the distinctive characteristics of the individual. Microsatellite DNAs have been proved a reliable marker for the individualization of animals. Seven microsatellite loci derived from domestic cat (Felis catus) were selected to individualize tigers, namely F41, F42, F146, Fca304, Fca391, Fca441 and Fca453. A reference population containing 37 unrelated tigers were used to investigate alleles, allelic frequencies, genotypes and genotype frequencies of each locus. Consequently, the data was used to assess the validity of the combination of seven loci for tiger individualization. All loci were polymorphic and easy to amplify. Three out of the seven loci were significantly departure from the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (P < 0.05). Cumulative discrimination power (DP) calculated with observed genotype frequencies was 0.99999789. Match probability of an individual in the reference population with a random individual in seven loci ranged from 7.34 x 10(-9) to 2.77 x 10(-5). This suggests that combining the seven microsatellite loci provides desirable power to individualize tigers. The combination of seven loci was applied to a case of tiger bone smuggling.

{"Abstract": ["Xa3-mediated resistance for rice bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide, is influenced by genetic background. Xa3 is genetically tightly linked to Xa26, another gene for bacterial blight resistance. Xa26 belongs to a clustered multigene family encoding leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-like proteins. To characterize Xa3, we fine mapped it using a population segregating for only one resistance gene and markers developed from Xa26 family. Genetic analysis showed that Xa3 co-segregated with the marker of Xa26 gene and segregated from the markers of other members of Xa26 family. DNA fingerprinting revealed that rice line IRBB3 carrying Xa3 had the same copy numbers of Xa26 family members as rice line Minghui 63 carrying Xa26. Phenotypic comparison showed that all the rice lines carrying either Xa3 or Xa26 developed dark brown deposition at the border between the lesion caused by incompatible-pathogen infection and health leaf tissue, while other rice lines did not show this dark brown deposition in either incompatible or compatible interactions. These results suggest that Xa3 and Xa26 is the same gene. We name it Xa3/Xa26 to indicate the relationship between the two gene symbols. The putative encoding products of Xa3/Xa26 and its susceptible allele xa3/xa26 shared 92% sequence identity.

On average, RFLP analysis showed that the Arabidopsis EST probe detected more polymorphic bands in Brassica than the random genomic probe performed. More polymorphic RFLP markers were detected with the digestion of EcoR I or BamH I than HindIII. According to the number of bands amplified from each accession, the copy numbers of each gene in the genomes of B. rapa and B. napus were estimated. The average copy numbers in B. rapa of China, B. rapa of Europe, and B. napus, were 3.2, 3.1, and 2.9, respectively. Genetic distance based on the AFLP data was well correlated with that based on the RFLP data (r = 0.72, P<0.001), but 0.39 smaller on average.

{"Abstract": ["The association between community functional shift and dynamics of genomic DNA composition can be used to identify functionally relevant populations as indicator organisms for systems monitoring. In this work, fingerprinting-based community DNA hybridization was used to monitor community structural dynamics and identify genomic fragments whose abundance shifts were concomitant to changes in COD removal capacity in a reactor. A laboratory-scale anaerobic-anoxic-oxic fixed biofilm system treating coking wastewater was operated with (LR mode) or without effluent recirculation (LNR mode). The contribution to total chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal by the anoxic reactor increased from 4% in LNR mode to 26% in LR mode. Long primer RAPD (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA) community fingerprints of the anoxic reactor also changed most significantly from the one similar to the anaerobic reactor to one similar to the oxic reactor. DNA hybridization revealed one signature band of 2.1 kb shared by the anoxic and oxic reactors in LR, but not LNR mode. Clone library profiling of this band resulted in one predominant 2.1-kb genomic fragment (B3) with no homologous sequences in GenBank. Real-time polymerase chain reaction indicated that copy numbers of B3 in the anoxic reactor under LR mode were 69 times higher than that under LNR mode, concomitant to a significant increase in COD removal capacity in this reactor. The different patterns of distribution of B3 in the laboratory system and a comparable malfunctioning industrial system demonstrated the potential of this genomic fragment as physical markers in systems monitoring.

The H(2) production rate was the highest for ethanol type fermentation, 0.40 l (g VSS)(-1) day(-1) or 0.45 l H(2) (g COD removed)(-1). Microbial community dynamics and diversity were analysed using double-gradient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DG-DGGE). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles indicated that the community structures changed quickly in the first 14 days. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the dominant bacterial groups were low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, Bacteroides, gamma-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria; alpha-Proteobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, delta-Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes were also presented as minor groups in the three reactors. H(2)-producing bacteria were affiliated with Ethanoligenens, Acetanaerobacterium, Clostridium, Megasphaera, Citrobacter and Bacteroides.

We have found the ether extract of C. humile (CH-EE) strongly decreased the survival rate of the four human tumor cell lines: Hela, A549, HepG2 and SW480. The cytotoxic effect of CH-EE on 293 was smaller than on tumor cell lines. Flow cytometry assays and nuclear staining showed that CH-EE induced apoptosis in Hela cells. This process was accompanied by the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-3/7 and -9. Furthermore, CH-EE generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Hela cells.

{"Abstract": ["To collect information about the genetic diversity of the plankton community and to study how plankton respond to environmental conditions, plankton samples were collected from five stations representing different trophic levels in a shallow, eutrophic lake (Lake Donghu), and investigated by PCR-DGGE fingerprinting. A total of 100 bands (61 of 16S rDNA bands and 39 of 18S rDNA bands) were detected. The DGGE bands unique to any single station accounted for 38% of the total bands, whereas common bands detected at all five stations accounted for only 11%. Using UPGMA clustering and MDS ordination of DGGE fingerprints, stations I and II were found to initially group together into one cluster, which was later joined by station V. Stations III and IV were isolated into two separate groups of one station each. Some differences in grouping relationships were found when analysis was completed on the basis of chemical characteristics and morphological composition, with zooplankton composition showing the greatest variability. However, the most similar stations (I and II) were always initially grouped into one cluster. Moreover, stations that exhibited the same or similar trophic level (stations III and IV), but different concentrations of heavy metals, were further differentiated by the DGGE method. Results of the present study indicated that PCR-DGGE fingerprinting was more sensitive than the traditional methods, as other studies suggested. Additionally, PCR-DGGE appears to be more appropriate for diversity characterization of the plankton community, as it is more canonical, systematic, and effective. Most importantly, fingerprinting results are more convenient for the comparative analyses between different studies.

Through the genetic similarity analyses of the E. coli obtained from different sampling sites, the spreading of bioaerosol from animal houses to the ambient air was characterized. The results showed that the isolated E. coli concentrations in indoor air (9-63 CFU/m(3)) in 5 chicken houses were higher than those in upwind and downwind air, but there were no significant differences between the indoor and downwind sites 10 m away from all the 5 houses (P>0.05). The phylogenetic tree indicated that a part of the E. coli (34.1%) isolated from indoor air had 100% similarity with those isolated from feces, and that most of E. coli isolated (54.5%) from downwind at 10, 50, 100 or even 200 m had 100% similarity with those isolated from indoor air or feces too. But those isolated from upwind air had a lower similarity (73%-92%) with corresponding strains isolated from indoor air or feces. Our results suggested that some strains isolated from downwind air and indoor air originated in the chicken feces, but most of isolates obtained from upwind air samples did not come from the chicken feces or indoor air.

{"Abstract": ["Pinewood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) is an invasive species that causes a destructive forest disease-pine wilt disease. This disease has been prevalent in some countries in Asia since the 1970s. An amplified fragment length polymorphism survey was used to compare the genetic variation of native and invasive nematode populations in China and to examine the changes in genetic diversity during the invasion process. The genetic diversity of Chinese populations was slightly higher than that of American populations. Analysis of groups sampled from different invasive stages in China, showed that no obvious change in genetic diversity. Hence, genetic drift and founder effects are not obvious in the invasion process. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Chinese pinewood nematode populations were closer to Japanese populations than to American populations. On the basis of the genetic relationships among samples, two major invasion pathways in China are suggested. One is from Guangdong to Anhui and Zhejiang, and the other is from Guangdong to Jiangsu and then from Jiangsu to Hubei, Guizhong and Congqing. The results imply that it is important to reinforce both domestic and international quarantine to control the spread of pinewood nematode."], "Citation": ["Heredity (Edinb). 2008 Apr;100(4):356-65.

{"Abstract": ["In this study, we have investigated a new fertility restorer (Rf) locus for cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in radish. We have obtained a CMS-Rf system consisting of sterile line '9802A1', maintainer line '9802B1' and restorer line '9802H'. F(1) plants from cross between sterile line '9802A1' and restorer line '9802H' were all male fertile, self pollination of F(1) plants produced an F(2) segregating population consisting of 600 individuals. The segregating population was found to fit a segregation ratio 3:1 for male fertile and sterile types, indicating that male fertility is restored by a single dominant gene (termed Rfo2) in the CMS-Rf system. Based on the DNA sequence of Rfo/Rfk1 (AJ535623), just one full length gene in the sterile line '9802A1', in the restorer line '9802H' and in the male fertile line '2006H', was cloned, respectively. The three sequences correspond to the same gene with two alleles: Rfob in '9802H' and rfob in '9802A1' and '2006H'. These two alleles differ from Rfo/Rfk1 and rfk1 (AJ535624) alleles by two synonymous base substitutions, respectively. Based on the differences between the Rfob and rfob genes, one PCR-based marker was developed, and designated Marker 1, which is identical to the corresponding region of Rfob by sequence analysis. In the F(2) segregating population described above, the Marker 1 was present in 5 sterile plants and in 453 fertile plants, absent in 4 fertile plants and in 138 sterile plants, and was found to fit a segregation ratio 3:1 indicating that Rfob was single copy in '9802H'. Linkage analysis showed that the Rfo2 locus for our CMS-Rf system was distant from the Rfo locus by about 1.6 cM. The sterile line '9802A1' was pollinated by the male fertile line '2006H' and the resulting F(1) plants were all male fertile.

Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria abundance had significant correlations with soil pH and potential nitrification rates. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis patterns revealed that the fertilization resulted in an obvious change of the AOB community, while no significant change of the AOA community was observed among different treatments.

{"Abstract": ["The 16S and 18S rRNA genes of planktonic organisms derived from five stations with nutrient gradients in Lake Donghu, China, were studied by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting, and the relationships between the genetic diversity of the plankton community and biotic/abiotic factors are discussed. The concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), NH(4)-N and As were found to be significantly related (P<0.05) to morphological composition of the plankton community. Both chemical and morphological analyses suggested that temporal heterogeneity was comparatively higher than spatial heterogeneity in Lake Donghu. Although the morphological composition was not identical to the DGGE fingerprints in characterizing habitat similarity, the two strongest eutrophic stations (I and II) were always initially grouped into one cluster.

{"Abstract": ["Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) has served as the model system for sex expression in flowering plants and its sex type is predominantly controlled by two genetic loci, F and M. Ethylene is the major plant hormone that regulates sex expression in cucumber. The current model predicts that ethylene serves as both a promoter of femaleness via the F locus and an inhibitor of the male sex via the M locus. In support of this model, genetic, genomic, and transcript analyses indicate that the F gene encodes a key enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis. In this study, we discovered that the M locus co-segregates with an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-like genomic sequence in an F2 population of 96 individuals. This genetic association agrees with the prediction that the M locus is involved in ethylene signaling, thus providing another line of evidence in favor of the model. In addition, we generated an amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) map of the M locus, which was delimited into a genetic interval of 2.5 cM.

{"Abstract": ["Plant microbiota (the microorganisms that live in any associations with plant tissues) represents a rather unexplored area of metagenomic research compared with soils and oceans. Constructing a metagenomic library for plant microbiota is technically challenging. Using all the biomass without pre-enrichment could lead to vast proportions of the host plant DNA in the metagenomic library, doubtless obliterating the microbial contribution. Therefore, the first and essential step is to enrich for the constituent microorganisms from plant tissues. Here, a strong enrichment for plant microbiota was achieved by coupling SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) with NaCl, creating a predominantly microbial metagenomic library that contains 88% bacterial inserts. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that the metagenomic DNA of enrichments originates from very diverse microorganisms. At least 74 distinct ribotypes (at a 97% threshold) from seven different bacterial phyla were identified and mainly distributed among Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Additionally, a simplified version of Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) was developed for a quick and efficient assessment of the enriching procedures.

Expression analysis showed that salt-induced intron methylation of root zmPP2C significantly downregulated its expression, while salt-induced demethylation of leaf zmGST weakly upregulated its expression. The results suggested that salinity-induced methylation downregulated zmPP2C expression, a negative regulator of the stress response, while salinity-induced demethylation upregulated zmGST expression, a positive effecter of the stress response.

Isolates exhibited high degree of phenotypic variability as well as suitable traits for their uses as selected strains in SSF vinegar production (growth modality by superficial biofilm, no production of cellulose, ability to growth on ethanol media). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of representative strains showed that strains of Acetobacter pasteurianus have a close association to cereal vinegars, whereas Gluconacetobacter europaeus population is not favoured. Selection of single or multiple strains culture within A. pasteurianus species was predicted in view of their application in SSF technology.

Derived from the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) techniques, 10 informative SCAR markers were generated from 10 polymorphic RAPD and SRAP bands. The differences in SCAR phenotypes among different strains made these SCAR markers potentially useful to characterize 6 strains and identify them from other studied strains. Moreover, different SCAR phenotypes also made the other 17 studied strains to be divided into four distinguishable groups. The multiplex PCR assays were further established for the joint use of some SCAR markers efficiently. Compared with some identification methods reported previously, the special feature of this new molecular method is technically rapid and convenient in the practical use and suitable for analyzing large numbers of samples. Thus, the simple rapid PCR-based molecular method can be used as a helpful assistant tool for the lentinula industry.

Each hES cell line has been completely characterized. All the three cell lines expressed hES-specific markers and pluripotency-related genes. These cells maintained their normal karyotype during long-term culture and displayed a high telomerase activity. When differentiated in vivo and in vitro, the derivatives representing the three germ layers could be observed. Human leukocyte antigen, ABO blood type, and DNA fingerprinting were also performed to provide a unique identity to each cell line.

{"Abstract": ["The molecular basis of many physiological and/or phenotypic adaptations of alpine plants remains largely unknown. The upper leaves of what are termed \"glasshouse plants\" have been transformed into translucent bracts that cover their inflorescences. This change in appearance is believed to allow such plants to maintain normal sexual reproduction under very cold conditions. Thus, it is hypothesized that the foliar roles of these bracts have been altered as an adaptation to alpine environments. In the present study, a test of this hypothesis revealed distinct physiological and anatomical differences (especially related to photosynthesis) between the bracts and normal leaves in one 'glasshouse' species, Rheum nobile Hook. f. and Thomson. A cDNA-AFLP analysis, was conducted to identify candidate genes involving differential expression in bracts and normal leaves, detected 323 (5.4%) transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) that were differentially expressed (up- or down-regulated) among 6,000 TDFs recovered. In total, 110 differentially expressed TDFs were sequenced, of which 52 were homologous to genes reported from other plants. More than half of the candidate genes represented by the unidentified TDFs may be specific to the Rheum lineage or have arisen through adaptive processes in alpine plants. All putative genes involved in photosynthesis had been down-regulated, while those related to stress and defense response were up-regulated in the bracts.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed that levels of intrahospital and interhospital dissemination of clones were low. To assess the mechanisms leading to resistance, all 258 carbapenem-resistant isolates were analysed for expression of the chromosomal beta-lactamase (AmpC), the porin important for entry of carbapenems (OprD) and an efflux system (MexAB-OprM) known to extrude some beta-lactams. Carbapenem resistance was driven mainly by mutational inactivation of OprD, accompanied or not by hyperexpression of AmpC or MexAB-OprM. Metallo-beta-lactamase genes were detected in 22 carbapenem-resistant isolates in China, belonging to eight pulsotypes.

Significant chemical differences were revealed between wild and cultivated populations in terms of chromatographic profiles, principal component analysis (PCA) plots, and bioactive compounds contents. Compared to cultivated populations, the chemical profiles varied considerably among wild populations, of which some were remarkably similar to cultivated populations. Inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) fingerprinting indicated a genetic differentiation pattern parallel to chemical variation. Evidence strongly supported the association between chemical and genetic variation of S. ningpoensis.

{"Abstract": ["Hybridization is prevalent in plants, which plays important roles in genome evolution. Apart from direct transfer and recombinatory generation of genetic variations by hybridization, de novo genetic instabilities can be induced by the process per se. One mechanism by which such de novo genetic variability can be generated by interspecific hybridization is transpositional reactivation of quiescent parental transposable elements (TEs) in the nascent hybrids. We have reported previously that introgressive hybridization between rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Zizania latifolia Griseb had induced rampant mobilization of three TEs, a copia-like LTR retrotransposon Tos17, a MITE mPing and a class II TE belonging to the hAT superfamily, Dart/nDart. In this study, we further found that two additional LTR retrotransposons, a gypsy-like (named RIRE2) and a copia-like (named Copia076), were also transpositionally reactivated in three recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from introgressive hybridization between rice and Z. latifolia. Novel bands of these two retroelements appeared in the RILs relative to their rice parental line (cv. Matsumae) in Southern blot, suggestive of retrotransposition, which was substantiated by transposon display (TD) and locus-specific PCR amplification for insertion sites. Both elements were found to be transcribed but at variable levels in the leaf tissue of the parental line and the RILs, suggesting that transcriptional control was probably not a mechanism for their transpositional activity in the RILs. Expression analysis of four genes adjacent to de novo insertions by Copia076 revealed marked difference in the transcript abundance for each of the genes between the RILs and their rice parental line, but the alterations in expression appeared unrelated with the retroelement insertions."], "Citation": ["Hereditas. 2010 Dec;147(6):264-77. doi: 10.1111/j.1601-5223.2010.02181.x.

CRI-12 was chosen as the cotton foundation parent and analyzed by gene differential expressions between hybrids and their corresponding parents at seedling, squaring and flowering stages. The following approaches were considered the most viable candidates to elucidate the molecular basis of CRI-12: cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphisms (cDNA-AFLPs), gene differential expression ratios, and vegetative growth heterosis and yield heterosis for correlation analysis. The results indicated that CRI-12 plays a predominant role in vegetative heterosis in CRI-28, CRI-29 and Jimian18 hybrids at the seedling and squaring stages; the percentage of dominant expression in single parents was greater than other patterns; downregulated expression in single parents was higher than upregulated expression in hybrids, and downregulated expression in hybrids was the lowest of the four patterns in the three growth stage cumulative totals.

{"Abstract": ["Aromatase is a key enzyme involved in estradiol and estrone biosynthesis. Given that polymorphisms of the CYP19A1 gene encoding aromatase have been correlated with plasma testosterone levels, CYP19A1 may therefore act as a genetic modifier of the hyperandrogenic phenotype of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, no functional CYP19A1 polymorphisms that predict the risk of PCOS have been identified. We explored the role of CYP19A1 genetic variation in a large case-control study involving 1078 samples, in which five common genetic polymorphisms were scored. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transiently transfected with a vector encoding either the CYP19A1 wild-type (WT) allele or an Arg(264)Cys variant to evaluate aromatase activity. Cells were cultured with androstenedione and estrone levels were measured using a specific ELISA. The Arg(264)Cys variant of CYP19A1 (rs700519) is associated with PCOS (P= 0.004, corrected P = 0.02). In this functional study, when cells were cultured in varying concentrations of androstenedione (100, 400 and 500 nM), transfection with the Arg(264)Cys variant resulted in increased conversion of androstenedione to estrogen when compared with transfection with the WT construct (P< 0.001).

{"Abstract": ["A novel actinomycete strain, designated TRM 40133(T), was isolated from a hypersaline habitat of Tarim basin in Xinjiang Province, north-west China. Its taxonomic status was determined using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on an almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain showed that it formed a well-seperated sub-branch within the radiation of the genus Saccharopolyspora. The highest levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity was found between the strain TRM 40133(T) and Saccharopolyspora qijiaojingensis YIM 91168(T) (96.5%). The chemotaxonomic characteristics of the isolate are typical for the genus Saccharopolyspora. It contained meso-DAP as the diagnostic diamino acid. Whole cell hydrolysate contained arabinose, xylose, ribose and glucose. The diagnostic phospholipids were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and two unknown phospholipids. The main menaquinone was MK-9(H(6)) and MK-9(H(4)). No mycolic acid was detected. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C(16:0) and anteiso-C(17:0). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68.2\u00a0mol%. In addition, the strain TRM 40133(T) had a phenotypic profile that readily distinguished it from the recognized representatives of the genus Saccharopolyspora. The strain TRM 40133(T) therefore represents a novel species of the genus Saccharopolyspora, for which the name Saccharopolyspora lacisalsi sp. nov. is proposed.

Identification of these responses to known anthropogenic pollution is of particular interest to better understand the growth dynamics and activities of nitrogen transforming microorganisms in marine environments. This chapter discusses currently available methods including molecular ecological analysis using clone library constructions with specific molecular genetic markers for delineating community changes of Beta-AOB, AOA, and anammox bacteria. Using data on ammonia-oxidizing microbial community structures from Jiaozhou Bay in North China and three marine environments with anthropogenic pollution gradients in South China from coastal Mai Po Nature Reserve of Hong Kong to the South China Sea as examples, statistical analyses packages (DOTUR, UniFrac, and Canoco) are presented as useful tools to illustrate the relationship between changes in nitrogen metabolizing microbial communities and established environmental variables."], "Citation": ["Methods Enzymol. 2011;496:35-62. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-386489-5.00002-6."], "TitleName": ["Responses of aerobic and anaerobic ammonia/ammonium-oxidizing microorganisms to anthropogenic pollution in coastal marine environments."], "AuthorsName": ["Cao H", "1", "Li M", "Dang H", "Gu JD"], "pmid": ["21514459 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]"], "AuthorInformation": ["1", "School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong SAR, PR China."], "email": [], "FullTextLink": ["http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B978-0-12-386489-5.00002-6"]},

{"Abstract": ["Allopolyploidy has played a prominent role in organismal evolution, particularly in angiosperms. Allohexaploidization is a critical step leading to the formation of common wheat as a new species, Triticum aestivum, as well as for bestowing its remarkable adaptability. A recent study documented that the initial stages of wheat allohexaploidization was associated with rampant genetic and epigenetic instabilities at genomic regions flanking a retrotransposon family named Veju. Although this finding is in line with the prevailing opinion of rapid genomic instability associated with nascent plant allopolyploidy, its relevance to speciation of T. aestivum remains unclear. Here, we show that genetic instability at genomic regions flanking the Veju, flanking a more abundant retroelement BARE-1, as well as at a large number of randomly sampled genomic loci, is all extremely rare or nonexistent in preselected individuals representing three sets of independently formed nascent allohexaploid wheat lines, which had a transgenerationally stable genomic constitution analogous to that of T. aestivum. In contrast, extensive and transgenerationally heritable repatterning of DNA methylation at all three kinds of genomic loci were reproducibly detected. Thus, our results suggest that rampant genetic instability associated with nascent allohexaploidization in wheat likely represents incidental and anomalous phenomena that are confined to by-product individuals inconsequential to the establishment of the newly formed plants toward speciation of T. aestivum; instead, extensive and heritable epigenetic remodeling coupled with preponderant genetic stability is generally associated with nascent wheat allohexaploidy, and therefore, more likely a contributory factor to the speciation event(s)."], "Citation": ["Genetics. 2011 Jul;188(3):499-510. doi: 10.1534/genetics.111.127688.

{"Abstract": ["D-Tagatose is a highly functional rare ketohexose and many attempts have been made to convert D-galactose into the valuable D-tagatose using L-arabinose isomerase (L-AI). In this study, a thermophilic strain possessing L-AI gene was isolated from hot spring sludge and identified as Anoxybacillus flavithermus based on its physio-biochemical characterization and phylogenetic analysis of its 16s rRNA gene. Furthermore, the gene encoding L-AI from A. flavithermus (AFAI) was cloned and expressed at a high level in E. coli BL21(DE3). L-AI had a molecular weight of 55,876 Da, an optimum pH of 10.5 and temperature of 95\u00b0C. The results showed that the conversion equilibrium shifted to more D-tagatose from D-galactose by raising the reaction temperatures and adding borate. A 60% conversion of D-galactose to D-tagatose was observed at an isomerization temperature of 95\u00b0C with borate. The catalytic efficiency (k (cat) /K (m)) for D-galactose with borate was 9.47 mM(-1) min(-1), twice as much as that without borate.

Five of these cultivars were issued from a Chinese breeding program. Genomic DNA samples were extracted from young leaves and PCR was used to generate SSR and ISSR markers. A total of 107 polymorphic bands were detected on thirteen SSR loci, with an average of eight alleles per locus. The observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.785 (DCA03) to 0.990 (GAPU47), and the expected heterozygosity varied between 0.782 (DCA03) and 0.940 (GAPU103A).

{"Abstract": ["DNA fingerprinting is both a popular and important technique with several advantages in plant cultivar identification. However, this technique has not been used widely and efficiently in practical plant identification because the analysis and recording of data generated from fingerprinting and genotyping are tedious and difficult. We developed a novel approach known as a cultivar identification diagram (CID) strategy that uses DNA markers to separate plant individuals in a more efficient, practical, and referable manner. A CID was manually constructed and a polymorphic marker was generated from each polymerase chain reaction for sample separation. In this study, 67 important sea buckthorn cultivars cultivated in China were successfully separated with random amplified polymorphic DNA markers using the CID analysis strategy, with only seven 11-nucleotide primers employed. The utilization of the CID of these 67 sea buckthorn cultivars was verified by identifying 2 randomly chosen groups of cultivars among the 67 cultivars. The main advantages of this identification strategy include fewer primers used and separation of all cultivars using the corresponding primers. This sea buckthorn CID was able to separate any sea buckthorn cultivars among the 67 studied, which is useful for sea buckthorn cultivar identification, cultivar-right-protection, and for the sea buckthorn nursery industry in China.

{"Abstract": ["Cryptosporidium is one of the most important parasites in poultry, and this pathogen can infect more than 30 avian species. The present study investigated the infection rate of Cryptosporidium among broiler chicken flocks. A total of 385 fecal samples from broiler chickens in 7 regions of Zhejiang Province collected from November 2010 to January 2012 were examined by microscopy. Thirty-eight (10%) samples were positive for Cryptosporidium infection, and 3 genotypes (Cryptosporidium baileyi, Cryptosporidium meleagridis, and avian genotype II) were identified by PCR and sequencing. A phylogenetic tree of the isolates was analyzed. These results suggest that cryptosporidiosis is widespread in poultry in Zhejiang Province, and is a potential threat to public health as well as the economy. This is the first report about the infection rate and molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium in broiler chickens in Zhejiang.

In this study we made use of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers generated from previous celery transcriptome sequencing and attempted to detect the genetic diversity and relationships of commonly used celery accessions and explore the efficiency of the primers used for cultivars identification. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of Apium graveolens L. var. dulce showed that approximately 43% of genetic diversity was within accessions, 45% among accessions, and 22% among horticultural types. The neighbor-joining tree generated by unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA), and population structure analysis, as well as principal components analysis (PCA), separated the cultivars into clusters corresponding to the geographical areas where they originated. Genetic distance analysis suggested that genetic variation within Apium graveolens was quite limited.

{"Abstract": ["The hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stain has stood the test of time as the standard stain for histologic examination of human tissues. This simple dye combination is capable of highlighting the fine structures of cells and tissues. Most cellular organelles and extracellular matrix are eosinophilic, while the nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes are basophilic. This review discusses the spectrum, intensity, and texture of colors observed in H&E-stained slides to illustrate their value in surgical pathology diagnosis. Changes in color of the nuclei occur in the presence of nuclear pseudoinclusions (such as papillary thyroid carcinoma) or inclusions (such as viral infection, surfactant, immunoglobulin, and biotin). The color of the cytoplasm of spindly cells can provide clues to their nature, such as basophilic (fibroblast), eosinophilic (smooth muscle and others), and amphophilic (myofibroblast). Eosinophilic globules have diagnostic value for sclerosing polycystic adenosis of salivary gland, low-grade B-cell lymphoma, solid pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas, and inclusion body fibromatosis. Eosinophilic granules are characteristic of granular cells (lysosome-rich), oncocytic cells (mitochondria-rich), and cells with secretory products (including neuroendocrine cells). Eosinophilic crystals can be diagnostic of lymphoma/plasmacytoma and crystal-storing histiocytosis. Basophilic granules or inclusions are diagnostic of acinic cell carcinoma and malakoplakia (Michaelis-Gutmann bodies). Yellow or brown inclusions are characteristic of hyalinizing trabecular adenoma of thyroid (yellow bodies), brown bowel syndrome, and malignant melanoma. Extracellular eosinophilic deposits can be produced by many conditions, but amyloid and monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease are important considerations. Extracellular basophilic deposits may be seen in small cell carcinoma and systemic lupus erythematosus, but they differ in that the former is blue (nuclear material) while the latter is purple (nuclear material plus immunoglobulin).

{"Abstract": ["The effectiveness of ex situ breeding programs for endangered species can be limited by challenges in mimicking mating competitions that naturally occur among multiple mates in the wild. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of timed natural matings and/or artificial inseminations in the context of the urinary estrogen surge on cub production in the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). We used a large cohort of giant pandas, including 12 females and 17 males. DNA paternity exclusion was used to pinpoint accurately the interval during the estrogen surge that coincided with the ideal sperm deposition time to produce offspring. Of the 31 cubs (in 19 pregnancies), 22 (71.0%; 15 pregnancies) were produced from matings occurring on the day of or the day after the maximal urinary estrogen peak. Sixteen of the 19 pregnancies (84.2%) produced at least one offspring sired by the first male mating with the dam. There was a preponderance of twins (12 of 19; 63.2%), and dual paternities were discovered in 3 of 12 twin sets (25%). These findings indicate a strong relationship between the excreted estrogen surge and sperm deposition to achieve pregnancy in the giant panda. To ensure the production of the most genetically diverse young, it is imperative that the most appropriate male mate first and on the day of or the day after the highest detected estrogen value. There is no advantage to increasing the number of copulations or mating partners within 1 day of the estrogen peak on the incidence of twinning, although this practice may increase the prevalence of dual paternity in cases of multiple births."], "Citation": ["Biol Reprod. 2012 Nov 8;87(5):112. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.112.102970.

This process is controlled by the balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic signals. The balance can be tilted by the cancer cells, which requires new vessel formation for progression. The stimulatory angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drive vascular growth by attracting and activating cells within the microenvironment of the tumor. Scientists believe that angiogenesis may be a rate-limiting for tumor growth and metastasis.

{"Abstract": ["Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Breast cancers are heterogenous and exist in many different subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, triple negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing), and each subtype displays distinct characteristics, responses to treatment, and patient outcomes. In addition to varying immunohistochemical properties, each subtype contains a distinct gene mutation profile which has yet to be fully defined. Patient treatment is currently guided by hormone receptor status and HER2 expression, but accumulating evidence suggests that genetic mutations also influence drug responses and patient survival. Thus, identifying the unique gene mutation pattern in each breast cancer subtype will further improve personalized treatment and outcomes for breast cancer patients. In this study, we used the Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) and Ion Torrent AmpliSeq Cancer Panel to sequence 737 mutational hotspot regions from 45 cancer-related genes to identify genetic mutations in 80 breast cancer samples of various subtypes from Chinese patients. Analysis revealed frequent missense and combination mutations in PIK3CA and TP53, infrequent mutations in PTEN, and uncommon combination mutations in luminal-type cancers in other genes including BRAF, GNAS, IDH1, and KRAS. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using Ion Torrent sequencing technology to reliably detect gene mutations in a clinical setting in order to guide personalized drug treatments or combination therapies to ultimately target individual, breast cancer-specific mutations.

This method adopts thermostable ligation for allele discrimination and subsequent PCR for signal enhancement. In this study, four polymorphic loci were used to assess the ability of this technique to discriminate alleles in an artificially degraded sample of DNA with fragment sizes <100 bp.

{"Abstract": ["Species of the genus Aquilegia are exceptionally diverse in their floral morphology and color, commonly known as columbine. They are widely planted ornamentals and are highly attractive for hummingbirds. However, little is known about their genetic diversity. We examined the genetic diversity of the species and cultivars using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Sixteen EcoRI/MseI AFLP primer combinations produced 327 informative polymorphic bands, with a mean of 20.4 bands scored per primer. Jaccard's coefficient of similarity varied from 0.61 to 0.93, indicative of high levels of genetic variation. Cluster analysis using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean algorithm placed the 64 accessions into two main clusters, each divided into two sub-clusters. The AFLP variability was significantly associated with the geographic origins, as the Asian species and the North American species grouped into two distinct clusters. The genetic diversity found among Aquilegia demonstrated the potential value of Chinese germplasm for cultivar improvement and for widening the genetic basis of breeding programs and breeding material selection.
